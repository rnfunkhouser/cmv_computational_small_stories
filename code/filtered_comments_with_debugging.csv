However, knowing and applying history, in my view, is far more important. That is the core of my argument here. It is important for leaders to be confident about the decisions they make. In order to do that, they need to look towards to past to draw parallels and inspiration and learn from mistakes.

ieiygec,AnythingApplied,"Your inability to change someone's view that isn't open or interested in changing their view isn't a problem of being taught the wrong persuasion skills.  Even if high school debate, your objective isn't to change the perspective of the person you're debating against, which is often futile, its to persuade the audience.  And if the upvotes in those comment chains are any indicator, you won the audience.

Changing someone's perspective online as a faceless and anonymous commenter is just such an insurmountable task.  Even with everything going for you from being right to being articulate, you just don't have the trust to change any but the most open minds.

Plus, most of what you're citing aren't debates at all.  They are people taking to the internet to rant, or confirm their beliefs, or troll.  Its like complaining, ""I interjected myself into an echo chamber and nobody listened to my points""... Of course not.  As an anonymous faceless commenter you simply don't have the power to force people to actually engage with your ideas.  Even if the specific person you're debating is reading your comments thoroughly enough to take pot shots at any flaws they can find, it doesn't mean the rest of the audience will.  And reading a comment to find flaws is a different exercise than reading it to really digest and understand the points they're making.",False
ieiyz60,Tnspieler1012,"1. I believe it's been widely observed (as in this [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolved_(film)) ) that the norms of high school policy is not at all designed with the intention of mirroring the type of discourse norms/debates one should expect to encounter in public life. Rather, it's intended to cultivate inherently valuable patterns of valid reasoning and argument assessment that helps the student to more critically evaluate arguments for themselves, while also providing them with some public speaking skills. Moreover, Patricia Roberts-Miller, while discussing argumentation education more broadly, also makes the point that we teach students more idealized forms of reasoning not because we expect that this idealized world awaits our students, but so that students will demand that their elected representatives emulate these norms of reasoning and argumentation. Establishing an unachievable ideal (see Habermas's ""Ideal speech situation"") is then a means to helping people to identify when and how people are using faulty or unethical arguments or persuasive appeals.

I would agree that supplementing this normative focus with more diversified knowledge of how deliberation occurs across contexts and communities is crucial to helping one adapt to new audiences or figure out to proceed in messier argumentative situations. However, this doesn't signal an inherent fault in the taught norms themselves.

2. I take issue with your characterization of many of your examples as ""debate"". Lying for political purposes, or bad faith gish-galloping for example, are only operating within a debate in a very loose sense. A broader education in rhetoric broadly construed, may better account for how this language operates than thinking of these as part of a traditional argument genre like debate.

3. I'm curious what you mean by ""**lose**...debates"" in your final set of examples. First, because I would be careful of characterizing most argumentative situations as win/lose agonistic encounters. As I suggested before, I don't think high school debate ever claimed to be the ideal approach to all situations where disagreement is present (see Douglas Walton's list of types of dialogue). The general goal of most arguments should be knowledge-sharing and critique in which all interlocutors benefit (see Daniel H. Cohen's [tedx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTN9Nx8VYtk&amp;t=373s)).

Second, it seems like you didn't lose, so much as you reached an impasse with with people who had different epistemic foundations than yourself. That's fine. Sometimes you can then move into a discussion about epistemology/authority etc., but very often the means to persuasion are simply not available with those people, so you just have to call it a day. In those cases, debate hasn't failed, because debate wasn't entirely possible to begin with. Not everyone can be persuaded in a one-off encounter.

I will go so far as to say I think curricula and education can do much more to prepare students to better address the epistemic foundations for their reasoning, rather than assuming that everyone accepts, for example, scientific institutions. However, I think this is less a failure of things like high school debate instruction than a sign that they see their goal as prepping students to either engage in academic and juridical contexts or to make their representatives more accountable, than to dissuade their neighbors of conspiracy theories.",False
ieize7i,LucidLeviathan,"1) I'm a lawyer. Those techniques are useful in court. In court, judges don't let you get away with a lot of the ""dirty"" tactics that you describe. While oral arguments and hearings are an extremely formalized setting, they are still vitally important. 

2) The defense to a strawman or red herring is to point out the truth. This is easier done in in-person arguments. Unfortunately, most of our political discourse today is done through the media, which is committed to ""both-sides-ing"" everything. The problem is that the arbiter is not truly neutral in this debate. The only way to reduce strawmanning in politics is to reform the media. I'm not sure what that looks like. 

3) The discussion about the other rights that could be potentially lost with the *Dobbs* decision is *not* a slippery slope argument. Slippery slope arguments require that the warned dangers are not the direct logical outcome of something. In this case, with Justice Thomas broadcasting the intent to revisit decisions, it is no longer a mere slippery slope. It is a stated intention that they are criticizing. 

4) The Gish Gallop is a relatively new debate tactic, so ideal defenses haven't yet been defined.  Online, you can do it by breaking up and rebutting every single point with every single reply. That's what I do most often on here and why practically every post I make on CMV has numbered paragraphs. In person, you have to be assertive and insist that your opponent give you time to respond to one thing at a time. You will have to be rude. You will probably have to talk over them. Once somebody starts with the full-on verbal gish gallop talking over you, it is unlikely that their mind will be changed, so really, you are speaking to the audience, not to that person at that point. 

5) When somebody comes to a discussion unwilling to have their mind changed, it's not really a debate. It's not really even an argument. It's two people talking past each other. Conspiratorial thinkers cannot usually be reasoned with because they discount shared reality. In any argument, you have to have a certain number of shared axioms. You usually don't have those with conspiracists. You didn't lose that debate because there was no real debate. The same goes for your climate denial argument.

6) I'm a pretty new mod to CMV. I've been learning a lot in the last few weeks about why our rules are structured as they are. We have extensive rules in this sub to ensure actually productive debate. That means that, at least here, you can learn some pretty effective ways of persuading people. Good debate happens when two opposing parties enter with good faith and with a shared set of views about what is and isn't fair game. This sub strives to do that. (Note: We also have a rule where we don't moderate threads we discuss things in, so don't take any inaction on my part as an endorsement or opposition to a post.)",False

iejspuy,rwhelser,"Only point I would argue here is the use of the term “democracy.” The U.S. was founded as a Constitutional Republic, not a Democracy. What’s the difference? In the Republic, power is in the hands of individual citizens. In a democratic system, laws are made by the majority. In the Republic system, laws are made by the elected representatives of the people. In a democracy, the will of the majority has the right to override the existing rights.

Additionally, the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

The founders did not trust a strong federal government, as they felt it would lead to a corrupt executive. And they just went through  a seven-year revolution to overthrow just that. I know you said don’t use the 10th Amendment, but that’s like saying tell me why it’s good to breathe oxygen but don’t talk about lungs. 

There are some issues to which it makes sense for states to have power. For example, minimum wage laws. How well does the legislature in DC understand how the cost of living is in Omaha, San Diego, Anchorage, or Buffalo?

When a crime is committed should the FBI be running point on how to deal with it? When schools in urban areas fail to achieve the success seen in the suburbs, is it Uncle Sam’s responsibility to fix them? Does Congress know better than the State or City Council? Should Uncle Sam decide which roads should be fixed and if so, how?

I think part of the problem with this kind of topic is the lack of understanding (or interest) in politics of the common American. Anyone can tell you who the President is, but do they know who their governor or mayor is? Do they know how state or local politics work? In my experience most say no.",False
iekk8up,LucidLeviathan,"So, I'm not really interested in these Constitutional or even historical arguments. I'm specifically reacting to the notion that returning decisions to states is inherently good because it means states will not be shackled by the federal government. This argument has been pushed relentlessly by conservatives as of late. My view is that if we are going to push the slider back to the state level, we should go ahead and push it to the city level. Yet conservatives aren't happy with such an outcome because it means that they cannot control the behavior of the blue cities within their borders. 

To put it explicitly, conservatives have asked why Louisiana should be shackled by *Roe* at the federal level. I'm asking why, then, should New Orleans be shackled by Louisiana's abortion law. That argument only makes sense if conservatives are then willing to let municipalities legalize abortion, for example. Insert any other issue as well that you might wish.",True
iekspr9,rwhelser,"Take a look at the examples I gave. Issues such as minimum wage, maintenance (such as roads), housing, and public assistance are all examples of policies that are much better handled at the state level compared to the federal level. 

Is it better to operate with only a federal minimum wage or is that better suited for the states? Or should every municipality out there conduct an economic analysis to determine what’s best for them (if you look at who is typically involved in local politics, and the way they operate, you might see why it’s better left to the state). If someone is seeking unemployment compensation or Medicaid benefits, should that be something Uncle Sam manages or should every city try to build up a massive budget to provide for that? Or are the states better off managing such programs. 

Often, states serve as policy testing grounds. Minimum wage, for example, was enacted at the state level before it became a federal law. More recently, the loosening of marijuana laws has been a state initiative even though Uncle Sam hasn’t followed suit (I suspect at some point in the not so distant future that will change). Gay marriage was a state level initiative until pushed to the federal level when DOMA was challenged in court (technically there’s no federal law out there saying gay marriage is illegal, in fact the opposite is what was struck down). Consider anything you need a license for. For example if every city had their own standard for driver’s licensing, would you prefer to have to get a license in every city you drive through in order be allowed to drive? Same for hunting and fishing licenses. Also keep in mind how much of a strain these issues would put on municipalities. You might think of a place like New York with a massive budget but consider some random township in the Midwest with a population of 50. 

With respect to your arguments about cities being shackled to the state, there have been instances where cities went against state and even federal policy. Take a look at sanctuary cities as a great example. Why don’t we see cities being more rebellious against state governments? Money. Same reason Uncle Sam can get states to fall in line. If a state goes against a federal policy one way to keep them in line is threatening to cut off federal funding (look at the covid vaccine debate for reserve and national guard members as an example). 

Fact of the matter is you can say you’re not interested in the constitutional argument but that’s the law of the land and it expressly gives power to the states. If you’re going to say I don’t care about the constitution argument then should it be on the cities to create/enforce constitutional rights because we don’t like one provision in the constitution? Should cities regulate their own free speech? Should cities form their own little militias, enact and enforce their own borders? Just keep in mind you can’t say “I don’t care about constitutional arguments” on one topic and then say you do on another. But I do understand where you were making your point.

A stigma is inherently a generalization. If 99% of something has a certain negative trait they all will gain a stigma for the negative thing.

iek62dk,carbonetc,"&gt; I've also personally managed to lose several debates thanks to bad faith tactics.

&gt; some people can use bad faith tactics to win.

You keep talking about winners and losers. How do you determine that you've ""lost"" a debate? What is the criteria? Does a guy in a black and white striped shirt walk in an blow a whistle? Discourse isn't a sport. To approach it as one seems to me to be a perversion and debasement of discourse. I don't know the extent to which high schools treat their debate programs like sport (I haven't watched or participated, personally) and I can see the value of the format as a learning exercise, but I hope they're clear that what they're having students do is still a big departure from discourse.

Here's maybe a better heuristic to go by for whether you've ""won"" a conversation. If people who are highly educated in the subject, honest, operating in good faith, etc. think that you presented your case in a rigorous, fair, and accurate way, you've won. Note that your counterpart can also have won if they've achieved the same. And note that you've still won even if you've convinced no one. If you're operating in bad faith, using underhanded rhetorical tactics that you would hypocritically object to if they were used on you, trying to win points with gotchas, deploying obvious logical fallacies, etc. you've lost. Note that your counterpart can also have lost if they've done the same. And note that they've still lost even if they've convinced everyone.

You'll probably call this idealistic, but I'd call it the only thing deserving of being called discourse. If you're in it to ""win"" rather than to have accumulated and expressed deep understanding of something, then I'd say you're more concerned about power than about truth. That's not discourse. That's combat. If what you want to play at is combat, that's fine, just know that it's a different kind of activity. Politics is rarely ever discourse; politics is combat in a poorly-made discourse costume. We need to always make room in the world for pure discourse to also exist, because there will never be any shortage of combat. Discourse doesn't need to be ""fixed"" by lowering it into the mud. You're correct that in combat you're lucky if there are any rules of engagement at all. Agreeing to rules and then breaking them is just another valid tool in the toolbox where combat is concerned, because combat is about power.

I take it that you value discourse and want to be involved in discourse, but other people are dragging you into combat.

This does not match up with your statement about Republicans being Fascist because 1. This is *less* government control and 2.

You defined it has reduction in quality of life. Find a place in the country, red or blue, that has not had reductions in the quality of life. Costs of living are skyrocketing. Gas prices are climbing. The homeless situation in some cities are out of hand. So is it necessarily Republicans fault or do both sides sit on their asses and blame the opposition?

Democrats with their affordable healthcare? Yeah you can qualify if you are so poor you can't eat and your quality of life is already shit. Throwing a bone to the poor for votes

Republicans standing around offering no solutions besides blaming Democrats? Sitting around doing nothing.

It is entirely possible people have been raised to provide a specific response to specific subjects without having ever been exposed to it.

It’s a similar phenomenon to homosexuals that are raised to hate homosexuality in religious/regressive areas, and they go so much of their life never really realizing their own sexuality, or hating themselves for the thoughts they may have when looking at members of the same sex. 

However, these same people when exposed to porn would _certainly_ end up gravitating towards homosexual porn. Even though they would have responded on the survey that it disgusts them.

It is entirely possible that this result here:

Politicians are schmoozers. They're wheelers and dealers. They're charismatic, and tell people what they want to hear. Their job is to raise a bunch of money,  make a bunch of promises, get a bunch of votes, and fire people up using base, partisan emotional responses. *That's* what gets the votes.

Meanwhile, the best judges are scholars. They're often thoughtful, quiet, and mild. They largely stay out of the spotlight, and aren't great at riling up crowds. Watch some interviews with RBG, Steven Breyer, or Neil Gorsuch. They're good speakers from a professorial/academic standpoint, but they would *never* get democratically elected to office.

Our lives are extremely comfortable compared to that of our predecessors; even the poorest in the US have access to stuff like toilets with running water and microwaves,  which is far more luxurious than what was available during the Civil War. So yes, even if the political division in the US is comparable to that of before the Civil War, society at large is not. Most people are not psychologically capable of giving up Facebook; what makes you think they'd be willing to slum it in a milita? 

On a similar note, you describe this conflict being between the two major political parties; Republicans and Democrats. Lemme break down for you why you'll never see Dems and Reps actually fighting it out. 

i. Most Americans are not gun owners. Most Americans are very, very uncomfortable with guns, as well as violence in general. I do not think most Americans would be willing/able to participate in major violence. Yes, there are Conservatives who are clearly eager to based on Jan 6, but in that case it isn't a fight between political factions. It's a fight against a group of terrorists and law enforcement. 

ii. There are more Dems in the US than Reps. At least 50% of Reps are over the age of 50. I can only imagine how many of those people have mobility issues, diabetes, heart disease, etc. I seriously doubt all the Meemaws and Peepaws are gonna wheel onto the battlefield, machine gun in hand, ready to fuck up the Liberals. Again, there are able-bodied people who are willing to get violent, but not enough for a war, or even widespread rioting. 

iii. On a similar note, most people are not actually loyal to the DNC/RNC anymore. In reality, most Americans are moderates, and most Americans generally dislike career politicians. It just *seems* like people are super partisan because the DNC/RNC are very good at maintaing control. 

iii. Lastly, conflict comparable to that of the Civil War requires a lot of time, effort, organization, and money. The middle class is overworked and underpayed.

iem2b2b,EarballsOfMemeland,"&gt; However, Defund the Police wasn't around in 2016 when Trump got elected. At the time, the biggest buzzword on the left was ""privilege."" Specifically, ""White Privilege"" and ""Male Privilege.""

&gt; These are horrible terms. Arguably the worst terms that you could have chosen to convey the meaning, for many reasons. First of all, the word ""privilege"" has historically been assigned to rich kids that have never had to work a day in their life. Who are completely out of touch with the real world because they've never had to participate in the real world. It has, historically, been a pejorative.

&gt; Assigning this term to the inherent advantages that some men and white people receive based on their skin color or gender was a huge marketing mistake. It automatically puts those groups on the defensive. They feel like people using those terms think that they've had an easy life of abundance and have never worked for a thing they've gotten. That what little they've managed to build was handed to them instead of earned.

Well by your own definition of the term privilege, the term is being used correctly in both White privilege and Male privilege. If a wealthy person is privileged because they have never had to work a day in their lives, ie walked in the shoes of those who have to say work on factory floors or dead end 9-5's, then a white person has never had to live as a POC, or a man never having to live as a woman and deal with women's issues (with the exception of men who have transitioned). If using correct terminology upsets people to the point of radicalisation then I'm not sure what to say. 

&gt; Pop Culture and Hollywood

Again, if Ghostbusters and Star Wars radicalise moderate men, I doubt they were that moderate. This section reeks of cherry picking, for every movie you mentioned as being overly feminist there's half a dozen more with stereotypically manly men do manly men things. Movies like Ghostbusters were cherry picked intentionally pushed by the right as part of the culture war. And it's not like men as a villain is new, it's been going on since the dawn of cinema. Was the original Star Wars trilogy pushing an anti-male, anti-white narrative? Or how about Death Wish, Commando, Die Hard any number of movies. Of course not, because figures on the right want to push the culture war.

&gt; Dismissal of Men's Issues.

Some of these points are valid. Yes, men's issues like high suicide rates absolutely deserve attention. But: 

&gt; However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.

By other men and by people who valued traditional masculinity. Not the left. You're saying that moderate men were radicalised in to supporting the parties that create the environments that support the Moderate Men's own oppression. I do agree with some other points here, yes there is a level of hypocrisy in body positivity, but again, the right does not even claim to try to make things better for men. They will say ""Well since men can still be made fun of for our bodies, we're not going to subscribe to any sort of boy positivity"", when obviously the better way of thinking is to fight for body positivity among men too. 

&gt; Tinder and Dating

The primary Federal law governing alcohol policy is the 21st Amendment, which repealed national prohibition. It also gives individual States control over: Whether to allow sale of alcohol in the State. Whether to allow importing alcohol into the State.

&gt; Men's issues have always existed, from suicide rates, to bias in the justice system and family courts. However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.

I haven't seen this. I've seen men try to *shut down* feminists asking for equal rights by saying ""but what about these issues that affect men???""

What I have also seen is that men who talk about their mental health issues, about feeling depressed, about just basically having emotions, tend to get shut down *by other men*, especially by conservatives. Example: I'm FTM, and there's this ""running joke"" with my conservative family members that whenever I show any sort of emotion that's proof that I'm really a woman. The left-wing people I interact with never say anything like that.

&gt; Then social media started allowing some hate speech, but not others. Hate speech directed at men or white people was blatantly allowed, while saying the same thing about women or POC would get you immediately banned. ""Kill All Men,"" ""Male Tears,"" etc, etc. Change those terms into any other demographic, and that would be hate speech.

Weird, because every time I've seen someone say ""kill all men"" on social media it gets taken down super fast.

&gt; When men spike out about these things, they were again told to go eff themselves. Even this very site did similar things. r/twoxchromosomes spews just as vile things about men as r/mra spewed about women. One was removed from the platform, the other is still alive and well today.

Literally what vile things are being spewed on r/twoxchromosomes? I'm looking at it right now and it's mostly people talking about abortion rights and violence against women. Linked examples would be appreciated.

&gt; Body positivity is another example. Women were 'all beautiful' no matter their size, while men were still openly mocked for everything from their height, penis size, or weight.

No, that's not cool.

So what are you doing about it? Are you just sitting there expecting women to start some kind of All Men Are Beautiful movement? Or are you calling out the people who say gross things like that? (It's both men and women who do that shit, in my own experience.)

Just a little protip, the main impediment of the male body positivity movement that I've personally witnessed has been the people who hijack it to whine about how women have it so much easier. And that tends to be the problem with most pro-men movements. Like, quit talking about women if what you really want to do is promote men's issues!

iemrf39,distractonaut,"Ok so first of all, I'm not autistic but I work as a speech therapist &amp; behaviour therapist at an autism-specific organisation. So, I'll share some of the reasons I've heard from people in the autistic community about why they don't like the term. I don't necessarily want to change your personal feelings about the term (you do you) but will just share some perspective.


1. I think a lot of people don't interpret the term 'highly functioning' to mean 'a highly functioning member of society',  but more 'highly functioning... for an autistic person'. So, the default expectation is that they *wouldn't* be 'functioning' well, so you need to label it if the person can actually live independently, have a job etc. I can see how this could be considered offensive, in a similar way to how describing a Black person as ['articulate'](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theroot.com/he-s-so-articulate-what-that-really-means-1790874985/amp) might be considered offensive.


2. Some of what you've described around studying facial expressions and learning to socialise - I have heard this be described as [masking](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#definition) which some in the community feel is kind of artificially forcing themselves to 'conform' to neurotypical expectations. I've read and heard a lot of perspectives of autistic people saying that they feel like they have to 'hide' their true selves to be accepted, and sometimes even to avoid discrimination or bullying.


3. The main reason we've stopped using the terms 'high functioning' and 'low functioning' at my organisation is that it really doesn't help much in terms of actually describing the person, their strengths and challenges. If someone is described as 'high functioning', people might assume that they don't ever struggle or need any supports when actuality they might be working really hard and under a lot of stress all the time. Or, be able to live and work independently but still struggle with social cues or sensory regulation. And 'low functioning' might invite people to assume the person can't ever learn independent skills or be a functioning member of society, when really they just haven't been offered the right type of supports yet.",False
iemtkbq,Guy_with_Numbers,"&gt; My reasoning for taking this stance is that I have manually learned all I know about socializing, something most people learn naturally while growing up. I've studied the people around me extensively, watched media (both fictional and reality) for hours on end to recognize patterns in speech and socializing. I've actively listened in on, and participated in conversations throughout my life, even though the most common reaction the first ten years was the others leaving because of something I said/didn't say or because I looked bored/uninterested. I've studied facial movements, expressions, and have had to manually manufacture my own expressions of varying emotions. At this point it's 85% automatic since I've been doing it for so long. However, I feel like becoming a ""Highly Functioning"" member of society is something we should all strive for, and therefore I am proud that I am classified as one considering the inherent disadvantages that stand in my way of doing just that.

I think you're following a somewhat different idea of ""high functioning"" than what that term entails. [The ""high functioning""](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/high-functioning-autism) is relative to someone with more severe symptoms of autism. That isn't something that we all have to strive for, because non-autistic people are the ""fully functioning"" benchmark already. That isn't even necessarily something that *can* be striven for either, as not all autism symptoms can be mitigated to such an extent through personal effort.

In addition, while your pride in mitigating your symptoms through your effort is entirely valid, that is something highly specific to you. Other people may see things differently. If I see someone with amputated legs swimming and I say, ""You're a pretty good swimmer for a legless dude"", some will see it as a compliment directed at their skill, and others will see it as a reminder of their shortcoming and how their achievements are qualified by that shortcoming. Likewise, you see the term as praise for your efforts, but others may see it as a reminder that they are not ""normal"".

Given that the positive connotation in both those scenarios (good swimmer/good social skills) can be conveyed without using a term that can potentially be perceived negatively (amputee/autistic), I'd say ""high functioning autist"" isn't a flattering term.",False
iemytgv,budlejari,"High functioning is not used when comparing autistic people to neurotypical people. It's always used as a comparison to 'low functioning' people. The 'stereotypical' autistic person. 

And high functioning is bad as a label because it does not convey what 'high functioning' means. Someone can be perfectly capable of sustaining something like a job, get home, and literally be unable to function because they are so overwhelmed and distressed by masking all day that they need help to do basic tasks like having a shower. They have to sleep to get over it, they have severe gastro issues because anxiety over masking, and they're unable to indulge in their passions because they're worried about coming across as abnormal. But they live in their own home, they pay taxes, and their boss thinks that they are 'normal' because they don't need to stim at work and they look normal enough to pass under the radar.

Someone else can headbang to self soothe, wear ear defenders when they go out because the world is too loud, and pathologically loathe metal cutlery so they'll only eat with plastic or their hands, but they're also capable of beautiful art and reading university level books on art theory. They don't work but they use their benefits to collect lego model kits that bring them immense joy and they're part of a regular Warhammer club that their dad drives them to twice a month. They have online friends, they do some side painting for their friend, and they're very happy in their own world. 

Which person is 'high functioning'? Which person deserves the label, if any? Does the fact that one person have a job mean they're 'higher functioning' than the other, even though it leaves them absolutely wrecked? The other person is on benefits, wears ear defenders in public, and can't stomach eating in a restaurant but they're  thriving in their own world, to their own standards, and they don't feel like they're missing out. 

Using labels like high functioning also diminished the idea of someone being autistic - it's suggesting that someone is so close as to be just like one of the 'normal people' so perhaps they don't need as much help or leeway as someone who is not at at that point or who chooses to *not* engage with society as a 'normal' person. Those people who use it as a term often use it as an excuse to disregard the autistic experience in the world and to assert the idea of there being different 'levels' of disabled and if you're not a particular way, you're not entitled to a kindness and tolerance for your disability because you are somehow *choosing* to not fit in. 

Low functioning implies that someone has 'failed to achieve' or that they are somehow lacking. It's often used to indicate someone who is profoundly disabled or who has a disability that is socially 'unacceptable'. They're not just 'weird' but in a quirky cool way, they are definitely Disabled with a capital D. Part of the difficulty with having children and adults with disability is that both they and their parents can be sensitive to the idea of 'not succeeding' being innate. It's easy to write off these people as 'not going to make it' by both professionals and parents, and those people can be disadvantaged by the idea that they're 'low functioning'. Just because they may not achieve total independence and will need support does not mean they will never do things on their own, have vibrant and passionate interests, or be an active part of a community, their family, and a wider society. Professionals and parents need to work together to understand the situation and to have reasonable expectations but assigning someone as low functioning effectively says, ""not going to thrive and achieve - don't even try."" 

Autism is not a one size fits all diagnosis. It's not a universal experience. Someone can have little difficulty in one aspect of their life but immense difficulty in another, and their level of need can fluctuate day to day, even year to year, or person to person. Putting people in boxes based on what they are 'percieved' to be capable of by using terms like high and low functioning does a disservice to everybody around them and the person themselves.",False

It can also be tiring, combative and, sometimes, manipulative. Constant disagreement leads to resentment.

ieoxt24,Scarecrow1779,"Your mindset reminds me of my own when I first got out of college. You assume all views are relatively equal in value and seek to moderate between them. Basically, you're saying, ""can't we all just get along?"" I maintained that approach through the 2016 election, and seeing the cascading results has absolutely disabused me of that world view.

The problem is, not all views are created equal. Some are held in good faith, while others are not. Some views are based on careful consideration, and some are not. Some people are willing to change their views based on discussion and new evidence, some are not. Some views may be misguided attempts to help others, while some views exist only for the purpose of selfishness at the expense of others. 

There is a common thread that ties together all of the negative aspects I just listed. They are fueled by a lack of empathy, respect, or consideration for others and perpetuated by a lack of critical thought or willingness to consider other views. Notice I did not say lack of *exposure* to other views, I said lack of willingness to consider. This doesn't have to mean that a person is inherently bad in their soul, per se. This can be driven by the opinions of those that surround them, the media they consume, etc. Specifically, the propaganda of Fox News and groups like it has been driven by fear, hate, lies, and dehumanization for decades, as a way to manipulate people for political and monetary gain. 

So, getting back around to my point: outside of politics and religion, views can often be discussed without vitriol and growth can happen organically. However, those two specific topics are where people are most often indoctrinated and manipulated by large groups to where the individual cannot consider other opinions. While at work, these topics can pushed into the background or ignored sometimes. However, in the context of a romantic partnership, there is no getting around or away from a person's political views, and they absolutely WILL effect the partnership when they are large differences in views. 

Think about all the things that couples have to consider together. Where will we live (so which state laws do we want to be subject to)? How do we raise potential children? How do we deal with medical issues such as unplanned pregnancy, planned pregnancy with complications, etc? How do we interact with friends of different races, beliefs, and orientations? If we have spare income, do we want to donate it to some charitable cause? Many of these things make politics inescapable and can deadlock normal conversations in a relationship if differences in views are too great.

So, the sum of all this is that some people's political opinions are too ingrained and negative to be ignored or worked around by their partners, and we have also shown many issues where a couple HAS to be in agreement for their relationship to continue. Therefore, it is reasonable to end or avoid beginning a relationship with somebody that has substantially different political beliefs than you.",False

iepg5cn,drogian,"Yes, but the first step to ""make [gifted programs] better"" isn't actually to build learning in a particular subject area.

Where I think gifted education fails is that serving a gifted student requires a two-step process:

* Reduce redundancy

* Provide opportunity

Education programs tend to skip step #1 and jump directly to step #2. But the mental health issues associated with giftedness tend to not be caused by a lack of opportunity to learn; gifted students (like many other students) will learn independently if the learning isn't forced in the classroom. The greatest need gifted students have is to not be browbeaten with busy work on a daily basis, leading to a sense of futility, purposelessness, and low self-esteem.

The first step in a gifted program should be to find ways to reduce redundancy the student faces. In a pull-out gifted program, this means that the gifted program needs to go into the regular classroom and reduce the amount of *work* the student is asked to complete to create and demonstrate learning in the regular classroom. As a second step, the gifted student can be presented with opportunities to learn that aren't just adding to a workload, which can include learning in small groups with similar peers--but this needs to be a second step (and sometimes similar-level peers don't exist).

This actually requires a paradigm shift. It's hard for people to realize that a good gifted program prioritizes *doing less*. But that's what's needed for gifted students. The first step is to empower those students to *do less*. The second step is to empower those students to use their newly-freed time to continue growing.

My point here is that, while you're right that gifted programs need to improve, the first step isn't to push students to develop additional learning in a particular subject area. The first step is to change the expectations for the students to respect what they've already learned. This provides what is sorely missing from many parts of the education system: respect for the student as an individual with unique needs.

The challenge is that many teachers of gifted students think they're respecting the student by treating the gifted student how the teacher would like to be treated in a classroom. The teacher confuses a *gifted* learner with a *mature* learner.

Most people who I've seen teach in gifted classrooms realize that the kids are smart, but actually underestimate how smart the kids truly are. People in general have a hard time realizing when someone is smarter than themselves, so it can be hard for a teacher of gifted students to realize that even though there is an age gap, the student is actually smarter than the teacher. This doesn't mean that the student already had content-area knowledge or understanding; the student being smarter than the teacher just means the student can pick up new ideas faster than the teacher can. But the teacher instead thinks the student is more mature than their peers.

Due to this disconnect, teachers in gifted environments often teach how they would like to be taught, with multiple repetitions in variously accessible contexts for diverse learning styles. But the kids don't need that; they can catch on more quickly.

So reduce redundancy.",False

This is the pro-choice stance. This is all we need from people. Many pro choicers personally would not have an abortion, or think it would be a hard moral question for them (or others to grapple with). 

We just don't think the government gets to force you to make the decision they think is best. We think it should be up to the mother and their healthcare provider at least up to viability. 

&gt;But I do think that there are good reasons to consider it a very complex issue, and not nearly as black or white as most people seem to make it.

ieq314h,animatorgeek,"I think you're giving short shrift to the idea of bodily autonomy. In US law there is never ever a case where a person is required to sacrifice their body for the sake of another person. You have a rare blood type that will save someone's life? The state can't force you to donate blood.  Your minor child needs a kidney and you're the only viable donor? Not without your consent.

Even if we see a fetus as fully human with inalienable rights, to outlaw abortion is to give rights to that fetus that no other human has -- the right to use another person's body to stay alive. It's telling the mother that she doesn't have dominion over her own body, which is antithetical to fundamental principles of a free society. So outlawing abortion doesn't just make a fetus have equal rights to other humans -- it gives the fetus *special* rights that no one else has, to the potential detriment of its mother.

Honestly, that clinches the argument for me. It's not a complex moral issue, at least as far as how to write laws about it. The ability to end a pregnancy is a basic human right. Each pregnant person can make personal decisions about whether they feel it's right or wrong. It's not the state's place to make that decision for them. That's what ""pro choice"" means.

As far as ""we should talk about it more,"" I agree with what many others have said. The talking should be done between the pregnant person and their trusted confidants and medical providers.

ieqvvlw,drogian,"Bodily autonomy in abortion and euthanasia aren't actually the same issue.

With regard to abortion, bodily autonomy means that the government cannot compel you to donate your body parts to support another individual. The government causes your body to be used for the benefit of another.

With regard to euthanasia, bodily autonomy means that the government can compel you to reduce harm to yourself. Your body is not being used for a person's benefit.

In both cases, the government is restricting what you can do with your body; but actively compelling you to donate your body to another is more invasive than preventing you from using your body as you see fit.

Someone who respects bodily autonomy with regard to euthanasia may also respect bodily autonomy with regard to drug use, seatbelt laws, public nudity, prostitution, etc. This is freedom to use your body as you wish so long as it doesn't interfere with others' abilities to use their bodies. This freedom extends to abortion under the understanding that a fetus has no right to life, while under the ""right to life"" view of abortion, this freedom doesn't extend to abortion, as abortion interferes with the fetus's body.

With abortion, the government is compelling you to provide life support to that fetus. You're compelled to donate your body parts to another individual. That's more extreme than not being allowed to use prescription medication without a doctor's note. 

Someone can be in favor of protecting bodily autonomy with respect to the invasiveness of abortion (saying the government cannot compel you to donate your body parts) while opposing bodily autonomy with respect to the invasiveness of euthanasia (saying the government can prevent you from harming yourself). In both of these cases, a person could be against self-harm.

And someone can be in favor of bodily autonomy with respect to euthanasia (the government cannot stop you from harming yourself) while being against bodily autonomy with respect to abortion (the government can force you to support another's life if you're the only one who can support them).

First of all, being pro-choice doesn't mean also believing gathers should be forced to pay child support. Those are two separate issues. 

Secondly, having to pay child support isn't an infringement on bodily autonomy the way having to birth a child is - a more apt comparison would be if the father was legally compelled to give blood every two months in case the kid needs it, and also be forced to donate any organs the kid needs at any point in your lifetime.

Somebody can have an idea, and build that idea up, grow it, and by doing so, afford other people the ability to make money with them. Yes, capitalism is flawed, I very much believe that corporatism and communism are distant cousins, but the benefit of capitalism is that there can be several different systems of control in different stages, and people can go from system to system, taking power away from one system forcing them to change.

Communism has a completely different goal, and that is to have the collective have common ownership of the means of collection. It’s a nice idea in theory. Even if we remove the part about how such a large systems means we only need a few evil people to make it evil, it is still not sufficient. The reason has to do with the one thing capitalism is good at: growth.

By nature, communistic system grow more slowly. Think of any massive business or government, and how long it takes them to act on issues. This is similar to why it takes communism to grow slowly. Who decides what needs to be innovated on? Where the money goes? The people? How would that work? In the US we hold a presidential election every 4 years. It takes months to campaign, and days if not weeks to tally up all the votes. Would every issue about funding be like that? No, it’s not scalable. So, we would need to promote people to make the decisions. What if people don’t agree with the decisions? Can we vote them out? This is one of the major flaws of communistic arguments, they never explain how it could work with 330 million people in the system. Communism works well in very small communities, just like a small business is much more agile than a massive corporation, but as it scales, it slows down and becomes inefficient. Capitalism on the other hand has much more decentralized areas of control, so different sized systems (businesses) can do different things, and ultimately net a larger rate or growth.

The reason why growth matters is because of population growth. Let’s say you have a pizza and cut it into 4 slices for 4 people. Then a fifth person comes. How can you ensure each person gets the same amount of pizza as before when there was 4? You need a bigger pizza. Capitalism is by no means perfect, but it is better at growing the size of the pie so people are more equal as more people are born and needing to participate in the system. Communism can’t keep up. Over time the system deteriorates because it can’t handle the population.

So what ends up happening? They decide a split. Lower class people stay very lower class and poor, upper class people get to reap the benefits of the whole. This is how China, North Korea, Cuba (to an extent, not as successful) operate(s/d). It’s the exact opposite of what people want.

Since pur resources are not infinite we have to determine who gets what. Communism divides up everything equally which is wonderful in theory.

What happens is the hard working get the same things and paid the same as the lazy. There is no incentive to go above and beyond. This leads to less productivity and with that you get more poverty.

If your going to pay a surgeon the same as a fast good worker why would a person sign up for the extra stress. If you force people into the roles you think fit them the best then you take away freedom.


Capitalism on the other hand recognizes that people aren't interchangeable parts and some have skills that warrant better pay. Capitalisms competition for higher salaries leads to more productivity. More productivity means more wealth generation for all.

Capitalism leads to the hard working and skilled being wealthy. Social safety nets are in place to protect the most poor and needy.

However, these scenarios you’re describing such as not lasting long usually come from women who aren’t having orgasms. How many men have an orgasm and then sex is just over. So while I don’t think unrealistic expectations of male sexuality are justified, how would you feel if whenever the girl had an orgasm that was it, sex is over and you’re not worth the time and effort it would take to get one back. Because for a lot of women THIS is the reality. Bear in mind the equivalent erogenous zone for women of the male penis is the clitoris, not the vagina, and most women cannot orgasm through penetration alone. Not excusing asshole women, because they are out there, but I know a lot of women don’t care about size or stamina if they are also getting an orgasm.

With regards to ACTUAL responsibility, men will never know the burden of being the one who can get pregnant. Men wear condoms sure, but they don’t have to take hormonal contraception that amongst many side effects include increased cancer and blood clot risk. Even the more minor side effects like acne and decreased sex drive can be difficult to deal with. You roll the dice on whether to take these pills or accidentally end up pregnant and either have an abortion (which is an exceptionally difficult thing to do emotionally and physically) or stay pregnant and surrender your very own body for nine months and risk numerous life-threatening complications only to have a child at the end that you may not ever have wanted. I know men are held more accountable now when it comes to paternity etc but honestly I think this is a good thing because to have sex means to have responsibility.

I think you'r confusing cool and romanticized for moral and righteous. The fact is a lot of the coolest and most romanticized people in history and fiction are not good people by any measure of that word. 

People like Cad Bane and Bobba Fett represent the same thing that their more heroic counterparts like James Bond do. Absolute freedom 

Cause the cold hard truth is when you're one of the most skilled hunters in the galaxy, people leave you be. Everyone from the criminals like Jabba, the Empire like Vader and the rebels either actively don't interfere with you or make it a policy to fill your pockets. Essentially the appeal of Fett and Bane is the idea of being someone powerful enough to inspire enough fear that most people know better than to pick the fight at all. 

This appeals because most people in their day to day lives have no power. One word from the government, their parents, their boss, the police. That's all it takes to bring their world crumbling around their ears. To some degree it'd be amazing to be a truly free individual. 

There's also the fact that most prominent bounty hunters are absolute monsters that honed their craft. Cad Bane and Boba Fett aren't blessed with Force sensitivity. Theirs is the skill that comes from a lifetime dedicated to training and honing their skills until they are, in a word, flawless.  

Also most bounty hunters aren't that bad. Compared to the Galactic Empire most are practically saints. Most have some code of honor and rules they won't cross. For instance Fett does the job no take backs. It doesn't matter if his target offers to pay him 10x more; deal is sealed. Some hunters reneg on any deal that the specifics weren't correct (Like in the Mandalorian he refused to kill a child regardless of whatever deal he had prior). Compared to Jabba the slave owner, Vader the team and child killer and Sidious the Emperor their sins are drops in the bucket. You wanna be mad blame the Empire who literally set the system up this way. 

So yeah most people recognize Cad Bane is evil but they also recognize the skill and training necessary to reach his level while also slightlu envying all that give him. A true freedom and the ability to determine their own fates in a galaxy where every clone and soldier and citizen is but a tool in the system. In a way the bounty hunters are more free  than even Vader. That's not nothing to sneeze at. That's what's so cool and apealing",False

If you hit someone in the face because you are mad, that’s assault. But if you hit them on accident, you don’t have the intent so it’s not a crime.

Sex requires consent from both parties, and if Jane can’t make decisions because of the alcohol then she can’t have sex.

It all comes down to public policy decisions. Do we want to say that if you drink, you deserve anything that happens to you? Of course not! No one should be taken advantage of. Drunk people should not be manipulated into sex, or into signing contracts, or into any decisions that require them to make good choices for themselves. The law is designed to protect them from themselves. On the other hand, just because you’re drunk, does that mean you escape all responsibilities? Also no!

Someone who supports heteronormativity is someone who thinks/promotes the idea that its ""normal"" to be strait, this is generally based off the notion that most people are strait, in the same way most people are not dwarfs. Someone who is heteronormative would probably be nice to someone who is gay (just like they would be nice to someone with dwarfism), but would believe that they/their lifestyle is atypical. Something like having the only kiss in a film being a homosexual one could (in a heteronormative persons eye) imply to children that most people (or a very larger percentage) are gay, but heteronormative people view homosexuality as more of an anomaly.

Lately there has been a significant increase in the amount of representation of LGBTQ+ people in film television and video games, this is good, but many people note that we're approaching a point of significant overrepresentation (more so with minorities than LGBTQ people)

The idea behind Bumble is to provide a service that caters to women who would like to manage their dating app more easily. It allows them to control the flow of matches.

Now, you're right that one of the drawbacks to this approach is that there may be some potentially good matches that slip through the cracks. But I imagine by its market share that women (and men) don't find this drawback to be a large enough impediment to stop using the app.

ifcmpt0,PlatosPotatos,"A few considerations:

**First, you've assumed a narrow utilitarian framework.** That is, all your reasons can be boiled down to, ""murder is wrong because it causes pain"" (or forms of pain, like fear or grief). There is no consideration of one's right to live, nor of moral principles that might exist regardless of whether a particular outcome is good or not. It's worth considering that there are other moral frameworks out there, and there are reasons to be skeptical of utilitarianism. But that's a whole can of worms, so I'll stick to a utilitarian analysis.

**Second, it assumes perfect knowledge**. Part of the reason that even many utilitarians would reject this sort of thinking is that it is impossible. You simply cannot know that a crime won't be discovered. You cannot know with 100% certainty that this hermit actually has no one who cares about him. You cannot even know that killing him will be painless. Are you so practiced and precise that you're certain beyond all doubt exactly how to kill him instantaneously, with no chance for error? Do you know what comes after death, so that you can say with certainty that he won't greatly suffer there?

Entertaining moral hypotheticals is fun, but we usually make them to draw real conclusions about how we should act. If we're to gain a lesson from your scenario, it might be that building uncertainty into your moral calculus is a good idea, precisely because these assumptions are impossible. And if we add in uncertainty, this scenario would always be immoral (unless you believed there were corresponding *good* outcomes from killing him that would outweigh the possible bad outcomes).

**Third, even restricted to your hypothetical, you do not consider the hermit's potential happiness.** Even if the hermit does not experience pain in the moment, you are snuffing out any future happiness he may encounter. Assuming that you believe that happiness is a desirable thing, removing its possibility would be bad. You could try to counter this by saying that it's more likely he'll live a painful, unhappy life than a happy one. But again, you're not a soothsayer. You simply do not know what his life will be like (indeed, we don't even know what his life is like *now*, except that he is a hermit).

**Fourth, you also don't consider how this would affect** ***the person who does the killing***. People who kill other people very often suffer significant negative psychological consequences, even when that killing was justified. Aversion to murdering other people is hardwired into our biology, not to mention how ingrained it becomes through cultural reinforcement. To kill someone in the absence of any reason at all would almost certainly be bad for the killer--and assuming this person returns to society, it would in turn be bad for society.",False

ifgd4tk,xylek64,"I agree with your sentiment. I am also very passionate about climate change.

However, it's not as simple as people often make it sound. Our society is, quite literally, built on unsustainable practices. Uprooting that is not something that is in the power of any one politician, so making it our #1 priority is both unrealistic and impossible to happen within 10-20 years. I'll use the example I'm currently seeing play out.

I work as an engineer at a natural gas combined cycle power plant. It's a smaller plant, with 3 units (3 gas turbines, 3 steam turbines) that produce around 250-300 MW each, for a combined base load of 900 MW. Some larger scale plants produce MW in the thousands.

Our company recently shut down a bunch of coal plants. We're now facing a summer of record-breaking heat waves without a whole fleet of power production. We have been purchasing up to 3000 MW of power to meet demand than we are making just to keep the lights on for people, and a lot of that power is being purchased from neighboring independent fossil power plants. Currently, the company is making plans to replace the power lost from the coal plants by building some clean energy plants. But there's a large debate on how that needs to be done.

Solar energy is one of the most inefficient methods of producing power. The panels require a lot of space. Even with solar cells being as advanced as they are, it takes around 3 acres to produce 1 MW of power. So, for a solar farm to match what we produce at my plant, they would have to clear cut around 5-6 square miles to install the panels. Additionally, we don't have a good way to store energy, so in the evening, during peak demand, the solar panels are producing nothing. Then any day you have rain or clouds, you're out of luck.

Wind farms have a similar issue with the space to power ratio. They just can't produce as much per land mass as coal or gas. Wind turbines obviously have to be in very windy places. You'll only see wind farms in any significance in the midwest, around flatlands in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. These are useless in most of the US where the wind is not blowing all the time, and of course, weather affects them too.

Hydro is actually quite efficient, but it's not possible to make them on a large enough scale to replace coal or gas. For example, one of our largest hydro plants produces about 80 MW. And we only have so many rivers we can dam up.

Nuclear is one of the best methods of producing power. It's totally clean, doesn't take up a lot of land mass, and it produces a lot of power. One unit can generate between 500-1000 MW, and some plants have 3-5 units. But the red tape regulations around designing nuclear plants makes it hard to build and keep them running. Many nuclear plants have been shut down because people complain to their politicians about the ""dangers"" of having local nuclear plants.

A big thing to keep in mind is when they decide where to put them and what plant to build, that doesn't happen overnight. For example, it can take years to get a nuclear plant approved because there's literally thousands of pages of documentation and regulations before they even start building. This will take billions of dollars just to build one plant. And they're complex, precise structures. Once they start building, it will take usually more than a decade to finish. You're looking at seeing that nuclear plant in operation a good 20 years from now.

And cars. Cars are moving to electric, which is great, sure. Although, electric cars are hard to maintain and fall short of gas. The range on an electric car usually isn't as much as a tank of gas will get you, and if you're on a long trip, ""refueling"" isn't as fast as just pumping gas in your tank. There's also the infrastructure problem, and I don't know where you live, but there's not a charging station at my apartment. The closest charging station is 80 miles away. Lastly, what do you think will happen when everyone switches to electric when the power company is already struggling to meet demand?

The best thing we can do right now is to focus on plastics, which would help with legislation, but there's a lot we can do as the people to pressure companies to reduce plastic production, or to pick up trash, or start recycling programs. Going green is important, but it just can't happen in the next 10-20 years. That's idealistic at best, and we need scientists and engineers at the front of that effort, not politicians. Politicians don't have a plan on HOW to fix the problem, they just make promises that they can't keep. In the meantime, I think it's more than okay to focus on social problems that if not addressed, would only serve to worsen the climate problem (war, for example, is very bad for the environment).",False

It just seems odd to say that martyrdom isn't a result of a sound mind because it might not lead to the right consequence when this line of thinking isn't the reason why most martyrs historically actually commit suicide. Socrates did commit suicide (and it was a suicide for the means to avoid his execution where readily available to him) because of a deontological commitment to the laws of the polis.

But I’ll go through your points and address them and see if I can add some perspective.

Corruption, yes, not comparable. The United States has more of a corrupt bureaucracy, which is a different (and by some standards better) thing to suffer under. The struggle here is that a lot of the corruption is codified and legalized. Huge subsidies, bailouts, shadow political donations, laws written entirely by corporations and passed by politicians. A lot of our corruption is by and large, legal. It’s much better, but also frustrating and depressing. I can certainly understand why seeing outright illegal shit makes you feel this is nothing to complain about, but it is still very bleak when you think about just how difficult it is to change.

True, there is less poverty here, but you also can’t compare $300 in Bolivia to the US, the cost of living here is also significantly greater which means people need to make significantly more than $300 to not be homeless in the US. The conversion rate for minimum income is just not a good metric for poverty. Yeah, you can look at a fast food worker in the US making so much money and think you’d be so comfortable in Bolivia, but they also have to *pay the US price for everything*, so a huge portion of their paycheck goes towards the roof over their head.

Education is complicated, it depends, a lot of very powerful and damaging lies are more subtle than outright propaganda. We have a lot of textbooks with lies and a lot of people trying to actively rewrite history and minimize/remove Native American genocide and chattel slavery from our books. More recently, Texas teachers were advised they needed to present “both sides” of the Holocaust due to concerns that white children are being taught they are evil. You’re right though, it’s not so much one political party writing self-serving propaganda as it is white supremacy. Still a lot of shitty lies and omissions, it’s very tragic to see children being taught this way.

On paper, the murder rate in the US is about 3x that of Bolivia. I’m willing to believe those numbers are inaccurate, but major US cities are *much, much closer* to those of Latinamerica in terms of murder than they do any other first world nation.

The justice system here is still corrupt, but again, it’s more codified in large part than outright illegal activity under the table. Judges who own stakes in for-profit prisons have been caught sending all manner of vulnerable juvenile there on little to nothing. Because we live in a very free capitalist society, there’s nothing inherently illegal about being a judge who profits directly from a prison’s success and also being “tough on crime”. Of course, we have the highest incarceration rate and a fucking ton of it is minorities in prison for possession of marijuana.

ifn7yz7,hungryCantelope,"your arriving at a poor conclusion because you started with a bad premise, I'll explain. Before deconstructing you position ill give the immediate answer to you question, ""why not?"" because their isn't demand for one.  Men don't want this, you offered a hypothetical reason for it, but having a space for men to support each other doesn't require women to be absent, you can have male comradery in regular gym space.  Your hypothetical makes no sense and it feels like the real reason your came to that conclusion was because you don't like being discriminated against so your looking for a solution is compatible with the fact that you realize the women receive unwanted interactions and that isn't sexist

To be clear, such a policy is sexist, the solution is actually pretty straight foreword.  If customers want to not interact with strangers the gym could offer an area with certain rules, basically a minimal interaction area, don't look at each other, don't talk to each other, any more than the minimum needed to navigate using a public gym. Anyone willing to follow those rules can be allowed in that area.  This would fix the problem without discriminating against men or reinforcing the sexist idea that a man looking at or speaking to a women is categorically harassment.(not saying women aren't allowed to consider this stuff annoying but the categorization of it has harassment is an absurd framing that if you sat down and really hashed it out with them they would realize they don't even agree with it)

Having a mens only section so they can bro out not only isn't desired by people but doesn't actually fix the underlying problem you have regarding sexism  As soon as you accept the premise that there should be a women's only section (implying that any interaction a man has with a women is sexual in nature), the you have accepted that treating people based on their demographic is okay.  It feels like you are trying to have your cake and eat it to regarding  egalitarianism.  Either you accept men and women are different and should be treated differently (in which case those difference would be individually addressed based on their merit, not in an attempt to even out some kind of theoretical scoreboard), or you you reject that idea and try and make everything match, but you don't try and fix a non-existent problem  in order to even things out just for the sake of a theoretical victory in order to bluster the illusion that you still subscribe to that theory. Because what you end up with isn't matching what you end up is just 2 different statements one for each group. If men interact with women it's harassments, if women interact with men it's disrupting bro time, see you haven't actually restored balance, you just even up a meaningless scoreboard of abstract points, one-to-one.

One last note, if there is an actual reason men want that, and we persrcibe to a less elgalitarain view, then we could provide that for them, but the reason wouldn't be *well we gave women something so we need to give men something* it would be becaue there was an actual need for it, the issue with you hypothetical is that you have no real reason to believe it's a need in the real world, you just used it as a prop  in your scorekeeping arugement, then said ""but why not"", why not isn't a reason,  and the obvious answer is it costs resource to have dedicated stuff for limited use.",False

ifq4bcm,Tanaka917,"&gt;There are some who voluntarily spend time with and help people with very low social status scores, like helping people in need, the poor, the homeless, the intellectually disabled, the crippled, etc, but they're not driven by compassion and are instead doing this as a way to build up their own status, e.g. to look like a nurturing person who would be a high quality parent/sexual mate, or gain status in a religious community, etc. They might not have done the self-reflection to realise this though, as competing for status is so instinctive and spontaneus few probably think about how it effects our actions, and most people dislike learning about it too.

Mate I've volunteered a dozen or so times in my life. Very rarely and infrequently. Here's the thing. Specifically an old folks home and an orphanage. Almost no one notices, and even less care. In truth I was doing that shit and the only people who remember that are me and the old man in a retirement home who has not one family member. People so poor they need charities to live. That person does nothing for me as an objective standpoint. They are old people about to die and young people who will probbably never reach anything. The workers usually have better things to do than shower us with praise, the organizers stop by once a week/month and the outside world can't see me with x-ray vision. I gained nothing from that work not even a letter of praise/recommendation. If I had never done it my life would have been largely the same, minus some empathy and plus a lot of free time. Do some people use charitable behavior as a sttepping stone? Obviously. It's a good trick. But you probably don't hear about the 1000s of people who just do their charity work and move on because that shit isn't newsworthy.

&gt;The lack of compassion towards low status people in society. For example someone did a test/prank on YouTube where they pretended to collapse unconscious in the street wearing cheap clothes vs a suit. People ignored the first collaps but formed a crowd around and helped in the second. It very common that autistic or intellectually disabled kids are bullied and treated with disdain by adult teachers in school. Abusive therapists are also common in mental health support. Homeless people are seen as less valuable in general. The examples are endless and uniquitous in all societies it seems.

Can I see this video please? I ask because

1. I've seen similar and studies tend to indicate that people don't help when there are more people aand will more likely help when there are less people. It's called Diffusion of Responsibility. Basically if 1000 people see an accident, most won't call 911 because 'well someone is already calling them.' But when you see an accident with only 3 people you're much more likely to act.
2. I've seen a similar claim where someone said 'strangers would help a girl child faster than a boy.' The video they showed was in a park. The boy was sitting alone drawing and on the girl's turn she was crying. Obviously people would more likely help the child who looks super stressed out.

ifq5ey5,hewasaraverboy,"Seeing a new trailer for the first time on the big screen is way cooler than watching it at home on YouTube

Like you said they are made to generate hype and that’s what they do

Sometimes when I see a movie that isn’t so great, the trailers are the best part of the movie going experience

Now I do think it can get old seeing the same trailer over and over again if you go to the movies a lot.

I think the perfect solution to your problem would be if the theaters posted like a trailer start time and an actual start time, but like other commenters have mentioned - then they wouldn’t get paid as much since less people would probably show up

A good rule of thumb I follow if I’m running late or something, is that 15 mins after the scheduled show time you still get you in in time to see the actual start of the movie 

But I’ve always stayed on the safe side and even prefer getting to the movie theater 20 mins before showtime bc the content they have like pre trailers is usually pretty entertaining as well.

First, in your system, children and people with disabilities just die through no fault of their own, as do people who are simply unlucky but would otherwise recover and contribute to society. Humans as a group will most likely never be willing to accept this.

Second, it's completely unworkable without irreparably damaging our freedom and privacy. What would happen to someone who can't be identified under your system, like someone who is mugged and left unconscious without any documents? Your options are either that they are left to die, or that they are required (under threat of literal death, given the stakes) to have some unremovable, government-provided form of identification literally attached to their person. Are you okay with the government chipping or tattooing a barcode on everyone? Even then, it could get damaged and the problem would remain. On top of all of that, there are times when literal seconds count and taking the time to check if they can pay before treating them would cause people, even those who can pay, to die.

As another example, if there is an accident and someone gets a life-threatening injury that they can't pay for, do they have to wait until fault is determined before they can get treated? 

Third, one of the major drivers of prices in the United States is a reluctance to pursue care until it is an emergency, as we refuse to cover anything that isn't. Routine care and preventative maintenance are vastly less expensive than emergent care. Your change would drive a greater number of people to only seek emergent care, as those without insurance (perhaps they can't afford it) would have to ration their costs. It would put an immense and unreasonable burden on people to predict the cost of their care, and I would argue that this task would be essentially impossible, especially for those who would be most likely to have to do it.

Finally, it's not like health insurance companies are actually good, at all. Their entire business model is to try to weasel out of every possible charge. What happens to people if their insurance won't cover a procedure that they actually need, at least not without a fight? They just die while waiting for the insurance to approve necessary care because some algorithm somewhere decided that the expected cost exceeded the expected income from that customer? You'd also be adding a massive incentive, by your own admission, in favor of health insurance companies, which would inherently drive up insurance prices, by an unknowable but presumably large amount, as they could literally threaten you with death or disability if you fail to purchase coverage. Do you really think that making them the only possible way to avoid random death or permanent injury for the majority of people would make them lower prices, or would they take advantage of this to massively inflate healthcare costs?

Look, at a certain point you have to accept that there are reasons that no developed country lets people die on the street anymore. You have to pay to dispose of the bodies, you have to pay for the resulting increase in disease from a combination of rotting corpses and carriers of contagious disease being out in public, and people really, really don't like watching small children die, so you would have to pay for the resulting riots and likely actual insurrections as well.

So in order to disprove your statement we need to find examples of people who give compassion, care, and respect to people who are perceived by that individual to lack life competence or genetic quality.

But if people provide those examples, you suggest that they are not ""self-aware"" enough to know that they are not giving true compassion, care, and respect.

So I'll attempt to break down my own experience as a social worker to a more objective format. All of my clients are on a housing program - they are unable to make rent payments without government assistance. Most are not individuals I would go to for life advice, and many are fighting just to keep their lives together. They have competencies, but I would not consider many of them to have general life competence (though the reasons for that go far beyond the idea that they simply have genetic or personal failings).

-It is my job to give them respect. If they set a boundary, I respect it. Even if they don't want to pursue a resource I think would be wise for them to pursue, I don't push and I don't judge. There's always a reason someone doesn't want to try something that seems obvious, so it's clear that they know something I don't. I do my best to get the information I need from them about their progress without making them uncomfortable, and I seek to do the best work I can for them without crossing my own personal and professional boundaries. You could argue I do all that for the sake of not losing my job, but as you've said there are plenty of people in this field who are successful without showing respect. And frankly, if my workplace condoned disrespect to clients - lack of follow-through, disrespectful language, pushing solutions the client is disinterested in - I'd find a new workplace, because I know that approach is ineffective and cruel. I have zero people in my life who would know the difference between me working at an agency like that vs an agency like mine, so I don't do it for external validation.

-I show compassion. I'm not sure how to express this other than saying it outright. The people I speak to are dealing with challenges that are incredibly trying. I've cried with clients before about what they are struggling with. Acting neutrally and dispassionately in the face of that vulnerability would be cruel. And outside of the struggle, I'm interested in the other things they have going on in their life - their pets, their hobbies, their families, their likes and dislikes. They are real people who deserve compassion.

-I care. The first client I had who lost his housing kept me up at night for weeks thinking over anything I could've done differently, wondering where he was, how he was doing. I still do. And I do my best not to let it affect me, but I can't pretend it doesn't sting if a client I have rapport with loses their temper at me or says something insulting. It doesn't affect my work but it does mess with my head, because I care about what they think of me. Their thoughts and feelings matter, both independently of me and as they relate to me.

And then there is whether or not a global society of hunter/gatherers is more sustainable than a global society of modern vegans.

The reality is that a hunter/gatherer lifestyle would require a lot more land and resources than veganism for the more than 7 billion humans currently living on the planet.

If we were all hunter/gatherers and we were not producing those high yeilds from small areas of land with farms, we would quickly over-exploit what resources were there and many humans would end up starving to death.

You might have an argument that an ecologically sensitive hunter/gatherer lifestyle for an individual might possibly be more ethical than an average vegan lifestyle based on environmental impacts.

Ditto for obvious family members and things like that.  Similarly, if we started with black frodo instead of white frodo i'd expect frodo to stay black across in-universe depictions.  

Is it important to the story? No . Will it serve to distract?  I think so because we're race sensitive audience members and have been anchored in the universe to a character.

I think it'd be a bold option to make the chnages _knowing_ it would create a moment of dissonance and then be taking on ""righting a wrong"" from past inflexibility on casting, but I think generally the principle of ""find someone that looks like the last person who played the same character in this universe"" is a reasonable thing to want to continue.",False

There's no need to go back and retcon properties from the second half of the 20th century so that all the characters have more diverse backgrounds. We don't need Black Spider-Man or Trans Loki or Gay Ant-Man or Female Thor. Just *write new characters*.

Like, Kamala Khan does it right. They just added a superhero from a background we didn't see very much of last century. They didn't feel the need to take some pre-existing character and say ""Okay, forget everything you know about Magneto, now Magneto is a Muslim girl from New Jersey.""

Our media has already *done* Lord of the Rings. We've done it to *death*. We did the big cinematic Peter Jackson trilogy and yet we just won't stop. And it's honestly not even a very good story by modern standards. There's no nuance or sublety to it all. It's just ""there are good guys and there are bad guys and they have a fight and the good guys win.""

There is a particular reason why some characters who are ""Race-changed"" are considered respected characters, like ""Black Spiderman"" and ""Female Thor"", and some are not like ""Black Frodo"".

It's to do with AUs (Alternate Universes) versus re-doing an established character. Miles Morales was enjoyed by the community not BECAUSE he's a ""Black Spiderman"" but because he was a new version of a character in a world that was made with different story elements in mind. Miles had a different upbringing than Peter, didnt have Peter's name, has different motivations, has different characters to deal with, etc. Same goes for Jane Foster and the concept of ""Female Thor"", she's a different character than Thor Odinson, different storywriting and characters relationships and motivations.

Making Frodo Black or of an Asian culture but doing nothing else with the character/world isn't what helps establish a welcomed diversity into an IP. How do you make an AU for an IP like LOTR?

&gt;With eugenics you are aiming to eliminate some specific genetic component (like race or the like), whereas the reasons behind abortion in general can be multifarious.

And people getting abortions sometimes are selecting against various genetic conditions, thus those people are aiming to get rid of a genetic component because they don't want that in their child.

If there were people that on the inside believed or had a change of opinion that the USSR they got was actually better than communism that's entirely possible but the whole idea of Marxism which is what Bolsheviks based themselves on was that for communism to be achieved there first must exist an intermediate system called the dictatorship of the proletariat that would first completely defeat capitalism, undo the superstructure that allowed capitalism to continue existing (religion, classes, nations, castes, etc) and then undo it's own structure to allow communism (which is a stateless system) to take over.

Parents are allowed to make other contracts on their child's behalf. What reasoning do you have for this one to be special? If you want, you can outlaw underage sex. That seems pretty reasonable to me. But to government, marriage does not imply a requirement to have sex, which is why I think it's best to separate the two.

This contract is, therefore, special to many people. Also, how many 16/17-year-olds would be in a position to reap the benefits of marriage?  

If you can prove that those groups are significant enough to outweigh the harms of allowing largely unprepared individuals to enter a contract that society puts a particularly heavy weight on (and whose failure could lead to significant negative consequences), I'll award a delta.

While I can't comment on utilitarianism as a whole, I will say that it doesn't make sense to look at marriage through a utilitarian point of view because the people that are by far most affected by marriage are the two people getting married, not the rest of society. This is why I believe that in this case it makes more sense to place value on individual freedom than general good to society.

Continuing that chain of reasoning, it doesn't really matter what *most* people think because *most* people aren't at all affected by someone marrying at 16 or 17. If society has a problem with someone marrying that young, then too bad for society. The important thing here is to separate the will of society from the will of government, just like Twitter can cancel someone for saying the n-word but the government can't throw them in jail.

16-17 years are already taxed on their income since they work, so it's not hard to imagine a situation where two 16-year-olds would want to get married and file jointly. That being said, according to my argument, the reason people get married is not really the government's business in the first place.

16-year-olds might be unprepared, but that is true of many people no matter their age. Just because *some* 16-year-olds are unprepared doesn't mean that it makes sense to put a blanket ban on all underage marriage. There are perfectly mature people at 18 who are perfectly content with their marriage, so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a significant portion of 16-year-olds to be mature enough.

* Tradition/Aesthetic Preference

* Financial/Tax/Insurance Benefits

Based on these benefits, I will give you a counterexample under the premise that the only exception you are currently allowing for is in the case of terminal illness.

**Next of Kin:** Suppose John (17) and Jane (16) are in a serious, committed relationship. Unfortunately, Jane lives in an abusive household. Her abusive parents are currently the next of kin for medical decisions and they would make decisions that are not in Jane's best interests if Jane were to be unable to make medical decisions. Conversely, John would make decisions in Jane's best interest were he to be her next of kin. Getting married would make John into Jane's next of kin. Since they are already in a serious, committed relationship, John and Jane would like to get married.

**Spousal Benefits:** John has joined the military and receives benefits, including room and board, healthcare insurance, and a pension. If John was married to Jane, then Jane could also be a beneficiary. Furthermore, Jane would be able to live with John, away from her abusive parents.

**Tradition/Aesthetic Preference:** John and Jane are both somewhat religious and believe in abstinence before marriage. Since they are already in a serious, committed relationship, and are already convinced of the practical benefits of marriage, marriage seems to them to be a natural next step into developing their romantic and sexual relationship in a way that comports to their beliefs.

I would have awarded a delta on the point that minors may need to escape abusive parents, but that situation doesn't seem realistic enough for me to change my view.

Edit: Just to clarify, so you don't think I'm moving the goalposts or that my view has been changed:

I've responded to the military spouse benefit argument with ""why not wait?"". It has been my position that a policy preventing unprepared children from marrying and exploitative child bride situations but delaying a beneficial marriage for a year or two would be a good policy. My view would have changed from your points as you bring up abusive parents, adding urgency and answering the question of ""why not wait"".",True

Perhaps that lays outside your lived experience but I'm sure that many can attest to having been in or witnessing the sort of household that is, on the one hand, abusive, and, on the other hand, happy to see their duaghter marry (especially to a military man).

Why not wait? Benefits now are better than no benefits now:

* more suitable NoK

* Health insurance

* Tax deductibles and ability to file taxes together

* Legal benefits

* spiritual/traditional/aesthetic benefits

* mental health benefits

* etc.

Being emancipated does not carry the same benefits and may be harder, result in direct conflict with the abusive parents, lead to unwanted estrangement, etc. The outcome could be far more precarious for Jane's financial wellbeing and mental health.

Even if we stipulate that the parents would refuse on account of being abusive: it is also possible to bypass the need for parental consent for a minor to marry by seeking the intercession of a court. The extenuating circumstances of having abusive parents that would deny permission could be grounds for seeking such an intercession in which case the judge would be granting permission for the marriage.

It seems difficult to find good reason to deny people that both want to be married, subscribe to cultural beliefs that make marriage significant, and would receive practical benefits from partaking in the institution.

This is accurate, if you're speaking in Arabic, you would say Allah no matter your Judeo, Christian, Muslim affiliation.

ig15smc,rockman450,"You're asking really good follow-up questions, I appreciate that. Thank you. This is a sensitive topic. 

Muslims pray in Arabic no matter their native tongue. They'll call their deity ""Allah"" as this is the word in their religious language for the deity. While the Quran has been translated to other languages, the required daily prayers are still in Arabic across the Muslim world. So, because they constantly use ""Allah"" in prayer to worship their deity, they use that same word in conversation/discussion in their native language - though sometimes with different pronunciation - emphasis on the first or second syllable. Also, it's important to note that the word ""Allah"" is the word in the Quran for the deity even when translated to English.

Christians did not use the native language of the Greeks (New Testament language) or Hebrews (Original Jewish Language), as they spread in the early 1-3 centuries - they translated into the language of the newly converted. 

So, for example, as Christianity spread into Europe, the word for the Christian God in Spanish was translated to ""Dios"", ""Dieu"" in French, and ""God"" in English so that the religion could be relatable rather than continuing to use the Hebrew word ""Yahweh"" for God across all languages.

If you are an English-speaking Christian, you'll use ""God"" or ""Yahweh"" to refer to your God as these are the translated &amp; original words for the deity of the religion.

However, if you're a Christian speaking Arabic, you would refer to the Christian God as ""Allah"" because this is the Arabic translation of the word ""God"" and Christianity is translated into native Arabic language. 

Just as English speaking Christians would refer to Zeus as a ""god"" using the word ""god"" even though it's not the ""God"" they worship it is the English word for a celestial being.",False

ig0tw07,McKoijion,"Remember when you were a kid in biology class and you learned about mitosis and meiosis? All living organisms originally started as unisex single celled organisms. They basically divided in half to create new organisms. Then they evolved to sexually reproduce. Instead of just dividing in half, so your offspring are basically clones of you, you partner up with another organism and give half your genes to them and they give the other half. That way you have more genetic diversity and your offspring are more likely to survive.

Humans are sexually reproducing multicellular organisms. We all start off looking the same, then we differentiate in the womb. That seam on the bottom of your balls? That's where what would have become your labia formed your scrotum. Your clitorus? That's what would have become the head of your penis. [Here's a diagram.](https://imgur.com/XL8l1ry) You can't see it, but similar stuff happens in your brain.

But say something goes wrong. You should have been a boy, but your cells aren't receptive to testosterone? You'll look like a girl. But then you hit puberty and you start cranking out dihydrotestosterone. Suddenly that little girl turns into a boy. They always were a male, but they didn't have the right signal to develop male genitals until they hit 12 or 13. This is just one example, but there are a bunch of other things like it.

Modern medicine has has advanced a ton, but society doesn't know how to deal with it. We're used to a world of boys, girls, and a bunch of inbetween people that end up being classified in one category or another. In the past, none of these people ever met each other because it applied to less than 1% of the population. But now they can go on the internet and find each other. Then they come up with a bunch of terms to describe themselves. There are a bunch of weird developmental issues that can make someone's phenotype (they way they look on the outside) not match their genotype (what their genes say they should look like). Hence people have come up with a bunch of nuanced terms to describe themselves.

Ultimately, no one is choosing to be straight, gay, trans, etc. Nature and a little nurture decide that stuff for you. You're just figuring out how to live with it. Ideally, you have an XY or XX genotype and a male or female phenotype and gender to match. That's the easiest thing to live with in society and it means you can have natural born children. If there's a mismatch, you just have to make do. On the children side, you can adopt kids and/or use various reproductive technologies to have children. On the societal side, you can just convince everyone to be more accepting of your medical condition.

As a last point, this is sort of a medical condition in that there's a clear biological cause. But being LGBTQ, having random genders, or whatever isn't really harmful to the person. If you have extremely white skin, it's a disease called albinism that makes your life difficult. But if you're just pale, it's no big deal. It's not a disease, just a variation from the norm. And as I mentioned before, the whole point of sexual reproduction is to increase the diversity of life. All these weird new genders aren't hurting anyone, including themselves. They're happy and people in society who have accepted them are also happy. Meanwhile, you're choosing to make yourself annoyed over something that isn't really a big deal. If you can get past all the straight person awkwardness, LGBTQ culture is actually pretty fun.

ig11h69,StickyBraces,"I am sort of piggybacking off of /u/akoba15's comment, but I'll argue my point slightly differently.

I agree that in an ideal world, ""minors should not be able to marry under circumstances""; however, reality often differs from fantasy.

I will argue against your point that ""Allowing 16/17-year-olds (sometimes younger) to marry is completely illogical to me."" In fact, I argue the very opposite: that it is quite logical and intentional for those involved.

There is certainly potential for exploitation in both ""developed"" and ""undeveloped"" countries; however, I would argue that early marriages in undeveloped countries are often a result of the socioeconomic/material conditions in those countries and may thus be a calculated move attempted to be made (and sometimes succeeding in being) in the best interest of those involved.

I'll be quoting extensively from ""Ethnographie Empathy and the Social Context of Rights: 'Rescuing' Maasai Girls from Early Marriage"" by Archambault. You should be able to read a PDF online here. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41407519#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41407519#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Archambault is an anthropologist who studies the Massai in Kenya.

Archambault argues that a lot of early marriages come about not because of patriarchal values, but because of material conditions.

She gives the example of Esther, whose father is a herdsman in Kenya. The average age of marriage in the area has recently decreased substantially. Why?

Archambault gives two reasons. First, pastoralism has become almost impossible economically.

&gt;There is a pervasive sentiment throughout the region that pastoralism is becoming much more difficult because of the combined forces of land and resource fragmentation and dispossession, which have been accelerated by recent land-tenure reforms, increased climactic instability, continued state neglect, and increasing population pressure.

Marriage is an important part of building community among different tribes of the Massai. When economic hardship comes along, this means that it will be more heavily relied upon for the survival of the tribes.

&gt;Given these growing constraints on pastoralism, residents of Enkop must turn to their social networks for protection of and access to resources - arguably more than ever before. Maasai lineage, clanship, age-set, and marriage systems provide an institutional foundation for these networks. In this light, and at the risk of sounding reductionist, the continued (or even heightened) importance of ""customary"" marriage in connecting families to pastoral resources now under individual title and providing strong links of mutual support and reciprocity must be noted.

Second, education is not always reliable. This means that marrying off one's daughters may actually be more beneficial for their well-being than going to school.

&gt;So although sending girls to school is the path that most parents in Enkop are choosing to secure the future well-being of their daughters, the risks of dropping out and uncertainties related to whether or not formal education will lead to livelihood security make it less of an obvious choice than the human rights discourse suggests. In this light, choosing early marriage may be understood as a decision taken by parents who have lost confidence in the education system or in the economy or who do not trust their daughters' future to the hands of the state. So, contrary to popular belief, early marriage may be more effectively understood as a modern adaptation - a decision made not out of a ""deeply rootedcustom"" and ""patriarchy"" but, rather, out of love, concern,and insecurity.

Now clearly, I'm not arguing that this is an ideal situation. In fact, quite the opposite. Socioeconomic and educational opportunities need to improved in Kenya and hopefully we will get to a point where early marriages do not happen. That won't happen, however, without a nuanced understanding of the economic exploitation that leads to early marriages and attacking the core of the problem at its root.",False
ig2hj2l,breckenridgeback,"&gt; I still feel really strong about my opinion that a fetus is basically identical to a baby, so I want to really educate myself since the only thing holding down my opinion of restricting abortion is where life really begins or if it's really worth pinching off that potential life for the benefit of your own. 

First of all, we should be careful with our terminology. ""Fetus"", as a term, refers to part (but not all) of the developmental stages during pregnancy. Prior to about the ninth week of pregnancy, the proper term is *embryo*.

So: simply put, an *embryo* - which is usually what is at issue in abortion, since the majority of abortions take place before nine weeks gestational age - doesn't have much of any of the traits that make a human a human. An embryo doesn't even have a brain stem (the very simplest bit of the brain that controls things like a heartbeat) until five weeks in. The folds of the cerebral cortex - the part of the brain in which you actually think - don't form until about twenty-five weeks.

Up until that point, a developing embryo or fetus doesn't really have any uniquely human traits. It's no more capable of thought or consciousness than very basic animals, and I assume you do not devote too much concern to the moral status of a mosquito or a shrimp.

Yes, it can develop into something more, but an embryo is no more a human than an acorn is an oak tree.

Worse yet, if it *is* a human, then you should be against all sex for procreation - because every embryo conceived has about a 1-in-4 chance of dying before it's born (actually a bit higher than that, since that's for *detected* pregnancies and many of them fail immediately).

&gt; I believe life is sacred and everyone gets one shot at it, and to have it cut off before you're even able to have a thought feels really fucked up to me personally especially if its for a reason that's purely ""selfish"", like body changes or food cravings. 

This is, to put it mildly, a very dismissive framing of the reasons people get abortions.",False
ig2n7k9,Vuiito,"&gt;This is, to put it mildly, a very dismissive framing of the reasons people get abortions.

But I have nothing really to argue, you have solid points and the 1-4 embryo is a very strong swaying point at least for me personally  


I'm just struggling to really grasp the whole picture, it still doesn't feel right to me to have to label when something is alive and when its just cells. I'm still stuck on this mindset that all life is precious because we don't really fully understand life or death.

ig2oeqi,breckenridgeback,"&gt; First of all I'd like to apologize, I am slightly neurodivergent so I do not see when I'm being offensive very easily 

Well, a good rule of thumb is to assume that people often have good reasons for making the decisions that they do, even if those reasons do not immediately occur to you. Dismissing someone's reasons for doing something as trivial, pointless, or too minor to justify their action is likely to offend. Doesn't mean it's *wrong*, necessarily, but it's likely to offend (and it *is* wrong here).

&gt; I'm just struggling to really grasp the whole picture, it still doesn't feel right to me to have to label when something is alive and when its just cells.

Embryos are *alive*, they just aren't humans on a moral level.

It's natural enough to want to put the world into neat boxes. But the fact is that the world just doesn't work that way. Fuzzy edge cases and lack-of-bright-line situations are very common in ethics. If they weren't, we wouldn't need to think much about it!

&gt; I'm still stuck on this mindset that all life is precious because we don't really fully understand life or death. 

Well, if it is, you've got some big changes to make to your life. It's a self-consistent enough moral philosophy, but it's certainly not an easy one. Almost everything about your life poses risk to some non-human creatures - even a vegetarian diet with modern farming kills large numbers of (say) rodents.

That doesn't make it wrong, by the way! It just means that if you find yourself applying a special standard in one area of your life that you don't in others, you should suspect there's some bias in your thinking.

&gt; ik its stupid but, I hate that I feel this way but Idk how to over this feeling that it's more selfish to prevent someone else from existing when its not their fault..?

I would argue you are a monster if you choose the embryos.

It might help to reframe it in your mind.  No one is required to give their body and organs to another human being against their will.  You cannot even be required to donate blood.  Abortion is the right of a person to not use their body as a life support machine and all the risks inherent to that.  The unintended consequence is that the fetus cannot survive removal.

Additionally, the hormones released during birth and immediately afterwards are designed to make you *want* to keep your baby, no matter how terrible it would be for you or the baby.  They are incredibly strong instincts and hormones.  That is how a lot of infants end up abused and neglected.  Once the hormones wear off a bit, they are bonded to the baby and there's severe social consequences for the baby being taken away.  And after they are abused/neglected, they are incredibly difficult to adopt.  So you are creating a child to be tortured.

The ""potential"" to someday become a thinking, feeling person doesn't seem very relevant to me. Sure, under specific conditions that's true. Under specific conditions a sperm cell will become a thinking feeling person, but it's not, and there's a very good chance that will never happen. 

Why would an unthinking, unfeeling clump of cells be viewed as equivalent to a person? 

I'm also curious how consistent you are in your beliefs. If you were in a burning building and could save a woman or a petri dish with a fertilized egg in it, which would you save? Would there even be a moment of hesitation? Is there any doubt that you should save the thinking, feeling person with loved ones and relationships and who will suffer immense pain if she's allowed to burn to death? 

What if it were ten fertilized eggs? What if if were a hundred? 

I'm guessing the vast majority of people would save the woman, because the fact is, a fertilized egg isn't a person. That it potentially could be a person someday doesn't make it equivalent to a person.

2. It wouldn't be a good return on investment, because the government would spend two years training these people to be good at their positions; and right when they developed the requisite skills and knowledge, they'd leave and go to college.
3. Rebuilding houses and making community gardens is nice, but there's not really enough work for millions and millions of people to do that would justify the cost and resources of the program.

As you say, you don't condone this being done to reinforce stereotypes, but you have the condition of it being done for the purpose of that; the reality is that you don't need to be purposely stereotyping something to end up stereotyping it, it can be completely by accident. 

For example, it's quite easy for western trained musicians to look at or hear indian rāgas and think ""oh, these are just like scales, or modes"", then adopt this understanding and tell people they are using a ragas- which has often been done. The issue is that rāgas are a much broader concept than that, they aren't just scale information, they include a load of other form, style and time direction that western musicians simply don't package together in the same way. Equating the two is a massive oversimplification that erases a lot of the musical theory, culture and history of indian music 

The effect here is that you, just through (probably well intentioned) ignorance, end up stereotyping. 

It's therefore not enough to be merely good intentioned, you should also be aware to the fact you don't know the culture you are borrowing from that well and may make mistakes in your understanding of it.

igajhra,MostRecommendation84,"You've stumbled into a massive topic that there's a lot of papers already on, but the short of it is that a key component of culture you're missing is law/customs which are intertwined with social and political trust. Countries with high political and social trust tend to be more accommodating of immigrants, however it's also important to note there's a consistent negative correlation between social trust and diversity(hence Denmark/Germany having two of the most rapidly growing nationalist movements in Europe), or in other words, social trust is a finite resource that's depleted the more you take in immigrants, high political trust decreases the cost, but a cost remains. Countries with low political trust to begin with correlate with a negative perception of immigration and have a steeper cost in social trust when they take more immigrants on. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of real life-applications: social trust is linked to crime rates and corruption, political trust is linked to political stability. Political trust isn't directly correlated to social trust, however there's a lagging tendency for political trust to fall as social trust falls(likely due to the organization and growth of opposition parties like said above nationalists). 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, you can't just stuff the ""nice"" countries with immigrants and expect it to work out because they'll eventually stop being nice places either due to political infighting, negative attitudes towards immigrants and/or the ruling party, or rising crime/corruption. This is a massive component of what reactionaries are trying to push back against in terms of ""culture"".

igbsvtt,elmonoenano,"I basically agree with you. But I think there's a couple of ways where it can be inappropriate. One is to do a very superficial version of the music in a way that reinforces stereotypes. Minstrel music is the obvious example that jumps to mind. People in black face doing exaggeratedly bad grammar or dialect, ""Massa Massa"" type stuff, that encourages and enforces racism. But I don't think that's the kind of stuff you're talking about.

The other one, and the one that's trickier, is the Elvis example people are citing. Elvis is a little more complicated so I'm not going to address him directly. But there's a spectrum of appropriation. There's lots of white artists that mimic African American music. And probably at the more clearly harmless end are bands like UB40 for the reasons you mentioned. They're clearly fans of reggae and are influenced by it, even though it's not very good. But the odds that someone is shut out from reggae music b/c of UB40 (Peter Tosh or Pere Ubu were probably never denied a show or a record contract b/c of UB40) is probably 0 or pretty close to that.

At the other end of the spectrum is the musician I love to hate, Pat Boone. Pat Boone used his whiteness to perform Black music (specifically profiting off of Little Richard) in venues that Black artists were shut out of and making more money off their music than they were able to. Little Richard couldn't play the venues Pat Boone could. He couldn't get on the radio stations Pat Boone could. He couldn't get on the TV shows or get the record deals, etc. And it was b/c of his race. So Pat Boone made an entire career out of Little Richards music and the fact that Little Richard was blocked by racism and segregation from most venues in society. I think pretty much everyone would agree that that was wrong.

Most musical appropriation isn't Pat Boone, especially now that most of that segregation is illegal. 

People argue where Elvis falls on that spectrum. I tend to think he falls closer to the Pat Boone side than the UB40 side, but he's not necessarily as exploitive. Elvis played what was considered ""race"" music back then. But he wasn't covering Black artists. Most of his songs were written by white label mates at Sun or by the song writing team of Lieber and Stoller. They were definitely appropriating Black style music, and there's questions about how much they borrowed or lifted and how much they wrote, but Elvis wasn't involved in that. He was just the performer. Elvis did play segregated venues, but he wasn't using his whiteness as directly as Boone was. So, I kind of put Elvis more in a category of a bridge that introduces an audience from one culture to the great art of another culture. I think the Beastie Boys did that for most Americans as far as hip hop went. Gershwin did it for a lot of Americans in terms of Jazz. And I think these people actually open some doors. You can contest how much and how fair that is, but I don't think it's evil like I think Pat Boone is evil.

So, I agree with you but I think it's worth thinking about these two areas where it does seem to be wrong. I also think that on the Elvis/Pat Boone side of the the spectrum it's not always clear where the lines are and what's exploitive versus what's a cultural bridge that generally improves things for everybody and that different people will come to different conclusions.",False

Someone with a disability that means, say, they can't write fast, is going to be disproportionately affected by these time limits. At that point, you're no longer testing their understanding of the material, you're testing their abilitiy to take tests.

Which mostly isn't what you want. If you're going to get a job as, say, a research assistant in a lab, they want to know how well you understand the science. You're probably not going to be writing things under much time pressure, and even if you do need to do that, they'll have accommodations that aren't available in exams, like speech to text software or something similar.

So if a disabled person doesn't get that extra time, it's going to look like they understand the material worse than their fellow abled students, but they don't. The exam has given a false impression.

If they are given extra time, then the test will reflect their actual knowledge, not their disability. And they're probably going to disclose their disability to the employer anyway, so there's no reason the test needs to account for this information.

I am sorry to cause a misunderstanding.

Everyone with any kind of disadvantage or not should get a tailored learning experience to get the most out of them. If time is the problem than not only people with learning disabilities should have plenty of time to go through an exam but everyone should. There are people who unfortunately just are not capable to work under the given time constraints because their does not allow them to but they don't have a learning disability. Leaving those behind because the rules say they have to be able to perform under the same constraints as abled students even though they too would benefit from more time seems unreasonable. A lot of abled people won't need the extra time. But for the few who do it would probably benefit them just as much as it would people with learning disabilities. Btw I am not talking about people who are disabled but are not recognized as such but about people who have disadvantages in their brain structure who just simply don't allign with the symptoms of learning disabilities but do still struggle with academics because of it.

Now, lets also assume you are also not alone. Say two people hunting together. 

Daily bag limits in my neck of the woods are (5) per person of Rabbit and Squirrel. If you were to take 10 rabbit, that is actually a fair bit of meat. Rabbits weight dressed somewhere in the 2-4lb range so that is 20-40lbs or meat for around 1 a box of shells (25 count). Figure on $10/box - that is between $0.25 and $0.50 per pound. 

If you go multiple times, the license cost and equipment costs spread over more outings. 

Waterfowl has different limits - but some of the same economics. Ducks limit is 6 per day with a possession limit of 18. Geese is actually 5 per day with 18 possession limit. Coots are separate as are mergansers. Snow gees are limited at 20. 

Shells are more but that much more. Basic Steel can be had for about $15/box of 25. You could over several days take a lot of birds and a lot of meat.

Which man?

&gt; one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole.

Earth-centric is better than Human-centric because as implied above, not all humans are the same, but we can all reference the one Earth.

&gt; 0 degrees Fahrenheit is around when people die, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is also around where people die.

Not an accurate measurement: I've survived working outside on days that were 100+ degrees as well as below-zero. By this measurement, I should be dead at least twice, and because I'm not, we can say, reasonably, that this is not a reliable measurement whereas water will always freeze at zero-C and boil at 100-C given normal-enough circumstances.

&gt; A Liter is a cubic decimeter of water... if that doesn't mean much to you, well remember a decimeter is just one-hundred-millionth the distance from equator to the North Pole, so a liter is a cube that measures one decimeter on a side.

One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram. The cool thing about Metric is that the units are related, whereas in Imperial, you have to do more complex math to convert.

&gt; An Cup is a cup of coffee. A Pint is a glass of water. An Ounce is about one gulp. Table and Teaspoons are... 

This reminds me of that [anecdote about the first Polish dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowe_Ateny) that said under the entry for ""horse"" that ""everyone knows what a horse is."" It's not really a good definition or a reliably repeatable measurement. Who's glass? Who's gulp?

Even if you can't do all those things to re-determine what exactly a meter is in relation to the Earth or a kilogram / centimeter / etc, that just puts it on equal footing with the Imperial system, making Metric, at its *worst* equal to Imperial; and, at best, *better*",False
igkqowy,LetMeNotHear,"&gt;A foot is... about the length of a man's foot in a shoe.

Most people's feet are not a foot. There's enough human variance that to refer to something as 100 feet long could mean two *very* different measurements to two people with different feet. That's why people don't actually use their foot as a comparison, they just know how long the unit is. Like how people do with meters.

&gt;A meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 3.33564095e-9 of a second, or if you have trouble wrapping your head around that, it's one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole.

Yeah, but again, people don't actually use that. It's solid rationale for the basis of a unit, but people just remember the unit. Like they do with feet. I can say this with confidence, because I hail from England; the dreaded land where we use *both* systems.

&gt;0 degrees Celsius is when water freezes, 100 degrees Celsius is when water boils... cool.

This actually is a good system. You know that if it's below zero, there's probably going to be snow. And you generally know how cold snow is. And if something's over 100, you know it's as hot as boiling water. Again, a temperature most people are (unfortunately) familiar with.

&gt;0 degrees Fahrenheit is around when people die, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is also around where people die.

No. You don't get to do this. Your whole spiel is about the origins of the units, so lets bring up Fahrenheit's. The zero point for which is the freezing point of... brine. A solution of water, ice and ammonium chloride. That's not even the salt that makes most brines that people know about (that would be sodium chloride). That's completely fucking arbitrary and useless to most people. The upper limit is 90 (why not 100, Fahrenheit, you stupid fuck) and is based on an *incorrect* value of human body temperature. So you have the freezing and boiling points of one of the most common and important materials in existence vs the freezing point of an obscure solution and a mistake. Lol. Also, 100F is not when people die. Have you heard of the middle east? Arabia? India? Stays over 100F for weeks or months on end.

&gt;A Liter is a cubic decimeter of water... if that doesn't mean much to you, well remember a decimeter is just one-hundred-millionth the distance from equator to the North Pole, so a liter is a cube that measures one decimeter on a side.

This feature of metric is actually *insanely* useful. Makes it real easy to figure out how much fluid can fit in a container if you know its dimensions. Something's 1m by 1m by 1m? Ten litres of water, it can contain. How much is that fluid gonna weigh? 10 kilos. Easy peasy. What about imperial? Something's 1 cubic foot, it can contain 6.22884 fluid ounces... And it'll weigh 62.43 pounds. Christ. No way anyone who isn't a savant is doing *that* on the fly.

Metric is equally intuitive to those who live with it. Your mistaking *your own familiarity* with a system with its *innate intuitiveness.* I can say confidently that I can easily picture 300 ml, a litre or whatever else.

And then how do you handle exits and on-ramps in the left lane? That means you'd need a bicycle bridge for each of these that go the main path. And even then you'd have to consider the clearance required for vehicles passing under these.

And it's not just the cost of the initial building of these paths, there's also the continued maintenance, which depending on where you live and how your city/county/state handles maintenance, they might easily end up in a state of disrepair and become dangerous, to the point where bicyclists are at risk of falling into traffic.

I think your view is a noble one, but I just don't think it's feasible or beneficial. Highways are built to accommodate thousands of cars per day, and adding a path to accommodate maybe a couple hundred at most bicycles will just add an incredible cost without much added benefit.

The second case is much harder to discern, since you never truly know what is in someone's head, but when you believe someone is not arguing in good faith, things like attacking Straw Men they know good and well is not your position, the classic gish gallop, the I'm just asking questions despite very obviously implying the answers, and many other such tactics turn any attempt at reasonable discussion of ideas into a farce and this needs to be pointed out because they are incredibly dishonest but effective tools of persuasion and you can't really point that out without stating or at the very least implying dishonesty on the person you are arguing with",False

igpr8eq,Li-renn-pwel,"It seems you have been made aware that you are confusing cultural appropriation and culture appreciation at this point. I am going to answer your question “What is the harm?” for cultural appropriation instead of explaining the difference between the two. So there are three ‘types’ of CA (cultural appropriation) and they each harm a culture in different ways. 

1. Columbusing: This is when someone claims to have invented things that someone else has already invented. It is essentially violating a cultural copyright. There was one lady who posted a recipe of a noodle recipe that she claimed to have invented herself but was very obviously pho. This sort of thing is harmful because it removes the history of that item. It leads to cultures being perceived as having not contributing things. For example, a lot of Southern food is actually Indigenous food such as hushpuppies. Yet I have literally been told by people that there is not Indigenous cuisine because we were “killed off before they had a chance to create a cuisine”.

2. Mislabeling: This is more or less the opposite of the above. Someone takes an item, concept, practice from a culture that they think is cool or has a certain ‘vibe’ and puts it on a (sometimes) similar thing. One example is a WASP woman inviting her friends to a sauna where they drink wine and listen to relaxing music but calling it a sweatlodge. A sweatlodge is a very sacred ceremony among many Indigenous people of Turtle Island (North America). No one is saying that this lady can’t hang out with her friends in a sauna but why call it a sweatlodge when it has almost nothing in common with it? In this case it likely would have been done because attaching Indigenous imagery to something makes it seem spiritual and close to nature (due to stereotypes about Indigenous people). This is harmful because it actually makes it harder for people to connect with their own culture. I can’t simply google “sweatlodges near me” because so many of them are run by plastic shamans (people who appropriate Indigenous religions). It also makes it difficult for others to learn about it because they usually can’t tell when something is authentic and when it is a mislabeling.

3. Just the usual racist kind: this is when you reduce all of a culture into a trope or character. Did you know that there are over 300 different Indigenous nations in American and Canada? Because often in media if there is an indigenous character they are a mash up of whatever features non-indigenous people think are cool. You might get them having a Plain’s war bonnet, Mohawk hairstyles, Cree beadwork while speaking Cherokee words. This is obviously harmful in the same way any other kind of racism is.


ETA: okay, I guess the differences between appropriation and appreciation were not as well explained as I had thought… aside from columbusing, which is a purposeful theft, for something to be CA it must be something that is sacred, a closed practice, something earned, etc. Food is something a lot of SJW throw up as CA but I can’t think of any food I know personally that would count for that. When I have the example of hush puppies, I was not saying non-indigenous folks can’t eat hush puppies, I was pointing out that the miss-attribution of them have lead to their origin being erased and the Indigenous contribution  to American food culture being overlooked. There are plenty of parts of Indigenous culture that others can freely enjoy.

An example that more people might understand is Christian communion. There are lots of aspects of Christian religion and culture that others can freely enjoy and participate. Non Christian’s can listen to Christian music, eat food traditionally associated with Christian holidays and even attend church. However, with a few exceptions, the unbaptized cannot partake in communion. Some denominations, such as Catholics, require you to be part of their church to and/or in ‘full communion’ to partake. Communion is a very sacred part of the religion and for some, once blessed, is the literal blood and flesh of their god. It’s not that the entire religion/culture is closed for people but that there are a few that can only be done if you are part of the community or invited into it.",False
igprq3x,ItAintFamiliah,"Another word for the queer community is GRSM - gender/romantic/sexual minority. Asexual people are a sexual orientation minority.

Being asexual has nothing to do with romantic orientation or preference. Nor is it a preference in any regard. It quite simply means that someone does not experience sexual attraction to *anyone*. They may still be romantically attracted to people.

&gt; Sure, they may have been told they are weird and don't belong, but its definitely not the same struggles as homosexual and transgender people face.

I don't feel that an identity's validity for existing in a community should be determined by the average amount of pain and struggle they go through because of it. Besides, some trans person might grow up in a completely accepting and loving environment while an asexual somewhere else is being forced into an arranged marriage or heavily pressured into having sex while never knowing what's ""wrong"" with them. But again, in my view their struggle shouldn't mean anything in this argument anyways.

Also, if you consider the community's history to be important than here's worth considering: bisexuals historically welcomed asexuals into the community because they also were technically 'equally attracted to both/all genders'.

igpyhj8,LetMeNotHear,"Easier? Incredibly hard to say. The ease or difficulty of something like dating is multifaceted. However, the claim that neither sex has an advantage is wrong. Depending on what you'd accept as an advantage. There are numerous factors, most of which come down in the favour of one sex or the other.

If we consider ""having a larger percentage of those you are interested in being interested in you,"" to be an advantage, the numbers are in and women have the leg up by quite a way. If we consider ""being considered more attractive to the opposite sex than they are to your sex,"" to be an advantage, that also comes down in favour of women, though I personally believe that it's not a separate advantage, rather just the cause of the first.

If we're talking about ""likelihood to contract a disease/the disease's severity,"" men have the leg up there. HPV, as far as I'm aware only causes cancer in women. Same goes for ""likelihood of experiencing pain during sex"" (though that is self reported, and machismo may be fudging the numbers for the blokes slightly).

But the crucial thing to note here is what ""these people"" you're talking about are actually arguing. I don't think they're arguing that in *every facet* of dating, woman have an easier time than men. I'm sure some people, somewhere think this, though.

With most mammals, the minimum investment for the father to sire an heir is about 20 minutes of legwork. Easy peasy. Of course, this means that the optimum strategy for them to embark on is quantity. The more get you have, the more likely your genes will proliferate. Mothers on the other hand, are tied down for quite a while, sinking valuable time and resources on their get, of which they can have maybe a handful before a sabretooth eats them or they die from a splinter infection or something else prehistoric. So their optimum strategy is quality; pick the best potential father for your heirs as any time wasted on sub-par genetic material hurts your chances.

You wouldn't if you didn't have the ability to warm up your living space... in fact, you'd freeze to death.

Your issue isn't with the season, it's with the fact that you have the ability to create a comfortable atmosphere in one season, but not in the other season -- so of course you prefer the season you're comfortable in.

I'm in a country (the US) where it's highly abnormal not to have efficient air conditioning in your home. In most of the US, it's also very cheap to own (or have access to) outdoor activities that help you cool down (like going to the beach, going to a pool, swimming in a lake or a river, etc). 

As a result, I love the summer! My house is comfortable in the summer and the winter, and I have sports I can enjoy in both seasons -- there's nothing unpleasant about it being hot outside (it is 35 degrees celsius today, where I am) because I only have to deal with it when I *want* to be hot.

If you remove the issue (not having AC) from the equation, I think summer is objectively better:

* More hours of sunlight means more time for any activity that requires it to be light outside.
* There's no snow to shovel or ice to chip off of my windows before I can drive. There's no black ice to cause car crashes or make me slip on my stairs.

I had a trans friend describe to me once why she was in a bad mood. It was a lot of little things-- all she had done that day was wake up, get dressed, grab a coffee, and walk to class. But she had already been misgendered four times. No single one of these instances were from someone who meant real harm-- they were innocent mistakes from flawed people who, when corrected, apologized. But by the fourth person my friend was frustrated, and tired of defining who she was all the time.

Its these sorts of little things that can really weigh on a person. Even if the person making the comment means well, and even if the comment is barely offensive, it gets tiring. From the perspective of the person committing the offense, its just a little thing which they can learn from. But for the person receiving the offense, that might be fifth little thing they've experienced in the last twenty minutes.

This is the much-maligned concept of ""microaggressions."" The narrative goes that people these days have to walk on eggshells because they're too afraid to make a microaggression. But, when microaggressions pile up in one person, they don't seem so micro anymore. They seem (and often actually are) indicative of a broader cultural attitude that does not care about that person's comfort or safety.

Their life experience is not limited to this one mistake, and it can be exceedingly frustrating to be everyone else's learning experience.

The US system is great for ""around the house"" and ""agricultural"" use where tolerances are very wide. 

For example, if you're gardening and you need to plant a seed half an inch, you can just go up to the top of your fingernail on your thumb as the correct distance. Halfway up the fingernail for a quarter inch. Up to the first knuckle for an inch. 

If you're planting bushes or trees, 12 feet of space is really easy to estimate using your foot. Pacing off a 100 yard field for a game of American football is easy as well, if you're measuring bigger distances. 

All of these measures aren't going to be exact, but it is ""good enough""...a tree won't care if it's 13ft or 11ft apart... close enough to 12. A football game between kids still works if it's in an 84 or 116 yard field. A seed still sprouts if it's 0.3 inches instead of 0.25 inches. 

So people still use it because it's very convenient in situations where tolerance isn't critical. 

It's much easier to plant a tree 12 ""feet"" apart than to estimate 3.2 meters. You can plant a whole row and it will look uniform as each space can be consistently 12 of your feet. It will look *better* than if you try to eyeball the distance in metric, you'll get an irregular looking row.

Most women already do not put a name on the certificate if they do not know the father, and even if they put a name, the father has to actually SIGN in order to be liable for child support and have custodial, visitation rights when that happens. 

When fraud occurs, there are already laws in place to handle that issue if found out.

Secondly you can not put extreme punishments in place without being able to prove something was legitimate fraud. 

1.) If the woman knows this wasn't his kid, and leads him to believe it's his, this is fraud.

2.) If the man isn't sure it's his kid and signs before getting a test, this isn't fraud, this is on him. You don't sign first big decisions like purchasing homes, a car, or claiming parental rights over a child if your basis for that is that YOU ARE HAVING DOUBTS. 

3.) If the woman can not remember who the father is because the couple had dealt with a now resolved issue of cheating almost a year ago, it's not fraud to put her husband down, and once again if he agrees and it turns out the kid is not his, this wasn't fraud. He wasn't purposely misled and in this case, he was aware of a previous incident they worked through together.

For something to be fraud, you have to prove ill-intent. Setting up vague laws like this where putting a man's name down doesn't make him legally obligated until he signs, is wrong and also opens the doorway further for people to abuse it. A man could know the woman he slept with has multiple partners, agree to sign the sheet, and then claim he was misled into believe the kid was his when the DNA test comes back negative. Then boom, now the woman is a felon, going to get 10 years of jail time, according to the punishment you believe it should get. The child is going to have no mother or father. 

There's already punishments in place for fraud, including reimbursements for child support, emotional damage, etc. That is assuming, it can be proven too, and that's important. Punishments aren't for the vague, that sets the precedence for a system of abuse.",False

for example concert tickets as NFTs.

* concert promoters can get royalties on secondary sales (if you can't go and sell it to someone else, concert promoter can earn some %share of it) -&gt; they could use that profit to partially refund all ticket purchases (make them cheaper).
* there is a liquid market for the tickets of all the ppl that changed their mind/can't attend and want to sell their ticket. so you have always an overview of the cheapest ticket available.

ih2fn94,TuskaTheDaemonKilla,"When people argue that a pay gap exists, they are arguing that there are social and structural factors that cause women to be paid less in the long-term because they are less likely to get raises, more likely to have their career suffer from maternity leave, or they are being driven into lower paying careers. In simple terms, women's choices are largely responsible for the pay gap sure, but those choices are primarily influenced by sexist aspects of society.

One tangible example of this kind of phenomenon is the way teachers emphasize certain academics for boys and not for girls. In [this 2002 study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20909/w20909.pdf), a group of Israeli researchers followed three classes of students from grade 3 to 6. They periodically had their math tests graded by either teachers who knew the kids or 3rd parties who did not know them. The teachers who knew the students gave the boys better grades. The 3rd parties gave the girls better grades. The tests were the same. The researchers concluded that the teachers who knew the kids had an unconscious bias in favor of the boys. They speculated that the same phenomenon happens in the children's homes too. The long-term effect is that boys are encouraged by their successes in STEM precursor classes such as math and sciences whereas girls are discouraged because they see themselves doing the same, if not better, work as the boys but getting worse results and less encouragement. Consequently, as they get older they become less interested in these subjects, and that's one of the major reasons why we have a lack of women in STEM. This is just one area where this occurs. The same phenomenon can be replicated in sports, toys, relationships, etc.

That being said, I'm going to go further and argue men and women are not even paid the same for the same work. [We have studies that show that when women enter a workforce the wages for everyone in that workforce decrease. By contrast, when men enter a workforce, the wages increase.](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/88/2/865/2235342) A simple example can be found in the field of recreation — working in parks or leading camps — which went from predominantly male to female from 1950 to 2000. Median hourly wages in this field declined 57 percentage points, after accounting for the change in the value of the dollar. Similarly, the job of ticket agent also went from mainly male to female during this period, and wages dropped 43 percentage points. The same thing happened when women in large numbers became designers (wages fell 34 percentage points), housekeepers (wages fell 21 percentage points) and biologists (wages fell 18 percentage points). The reverse was true when a job attracted more men. Computer programming, for instance, used to be a job done primarily by women. But when male programmers began to outnumber female ones, the job gained prestige and wages increased even before the complexity of the work increased.

We also have [Bureau of Labour Statistics data](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.htm) which shows that women working basically the same job as men get paid less than them. Notably, the median earnings of information technology managers (mostly men) are 27 percent higher than human resources managers (mostly women). At the other end of the wage spectrum, janitors (usually men) earn 22 percent more than maids and housecleaners (usually women). This is despite the fact that these jobs require essentially the same skills/education.

There have also been studies indicating that when you account for all the other factors that might influence the wage gap, primarily pregnancy, you still find that women are paid less (around 94%) than their male counterparts in the exact same job, at the same level, and with the same productivity.",False
ih2g35b,zeratul98,"Okay, let me try to explain ways in which these things could be discriminatory practices and you can decide which seem plausible to you

&gt;So basically my view is that women are more likely to want to have time off to be with the family which leads to less total pay

Or perhaps they simply have to in heterosexual relationships. Think about this, maternity leave is common in the US, paternity leave is rare. This is a signal of expectations: that women take care of kids and men work. So if a man and a woman both try to reduce hours to take care of their families, who is more likely to receive a positive response. If a man and a woman are both up for promotions, both being young, married, and currently childless, who is more likely to get it? The women who is expected to eventually quit her career to raise her kids or the man who's expected to keep working? Men and women make different choices, but they make those choices within different expectations of how they will be treated 

&gt;My last point is the difference in negotiation skills between men and women which leads to differences in pay for the exact same tasks. “57% of male Carnegie Mellon graduate business students negotiate their starting salaries. However, only 7% of women negotiate salaries… men’s starting salaries… are 7.6% higher than women’s.” source It seems that women are (or at least used to be) worse at negotiation and lost some potential salary this way as well. 

Right, but ask them why? The answer i most often hear is ""i don't want to seem pushy/bossy/naggy."" Do women not negotiate salaries because they don't want more money? No. More likely, they're worried pushing for more money will be fruitless and be perceived negatively.

&gt;So, I hope this post doesn’t offend anyone. I’m completely open to new perspectives. It just doesn’t seem to be a “systemic” problem like the news would have you believe and seems to have more to do with our own personal culture of motherhood

Once again, the perception of negotiation is more of a difference between perceptions of men and woman and not of an actual discriminatory practice.

Perception of what? It seems like it's an expectation of how their employer will respond. Either that's a rational expectation, which would mean that yes, this is an example of systemic discrimination, or you think it's irrational and baseless, so then you'd have to explain why people hold this expectation.

A basketful is a measurement; metric seeks to standardize the size of containers to fit neatly with metric. That's fine, but it's solving for the fact that there's nothing inherent to metric that makes it more useful, once you're talking about containers full.

The 'system' there is cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons. America's standard measurement is much maligned for using these measurements, but they are *things you have in your kitchen.* For 200 years, soup spoons have been roughly the same size ... coffee cups have been roughly the same size ... etc.

This might make it easier to follow:

* There are 16 tablespoons in a cup; there are 16 cups in a gallon. Along the way, there are oz and pints and quarts that make it easy to chop each of these things in half or double them while still dealing with a 'whole number'.
* There are 1000 ml in a liter.

The tablespoons and cups are easier to use when you're measuring out literal spoonfuls and cups of things, and are very convenient if you want to multiply or divide your recipe by 2 or 3 or 4.

They're not the same measurement system as metric, but their benefit is in their simplicity and their ratio to each other. Keep that constant, and you can make them slightly larger or smaller without losing utility.

So make a tablespoon equal *exactly* 15 ml, instead of *almost* 15 ml. Do that, and conversion to and from metric is easy-peasy. A cup is 240 ml instead of 237 or whatever. It's also still 16 tablespoons.",True

ih7h9ja,Full-Professional246,"I think you need to separate out this view a bit.

There are originals and there are copies. These can be digital or real world or some combination.

In the 'paper' category, having an original vs a xerox copy. Generally speaking, originals allow for a much greater examination of the signature and the ability to have seals/stamps or other physical security devices not appearing in a copy. If you want evidence, the original is the version you want as it provides more opportunities to validate it is authenticity.

Moving to digital. There are mechanisms of digital signing to explicitly protect against changes. If you utilize this technology, you are creating numerous 'originals' to distribute. They aren't really 'copies'. A copy is a version of the document/file without said protections against change. Again, just like the paper side, if you want or need to verify authenticity, the 'original' is what you want. 

When you mix the formats, its gets more complicated. A scan of a wet signed form doesn't include all of the authentication capabilities of the original. It can though, include signatures and records of reception of this original document in its file and through those change protections. It can be almost as good because you have the file, as the authority holding the original claims it appears - with protections against changes. 

If your standard is merely a signature, then you likely are right. In this day an age, that is not much protection. (I kinda want to make an automatic signing machine now). But, when you include signatures with other tools such as a notary and registration of the document, you get more security.

There is a very important reason to worry about ""originals"" and ""copies"" in the digital world, because *when* and *who* created those things can be extremely important for civil, and especially criminal, cases.

Let's say that someone has their computer seized and a digital forensic search completed because of a suspicion of money laundering or some other financial crime, embezzlement, or something. If the documents and files on their computer weren't created by ""them"" (being, the person who had access to the account that created or modified the file) then the level to which they can be prosecuted is drastically less than if they're the originator of the documents. 

Another example is cases that I've read about where someone was accused of possessing CSAM, or other types of illegal digital content. If the person being accused can prove that they don't have access to the account that created the file, then they didn't break any laws, and the investigation will be about the person or people who have access to the accounts that created the file. 

Moving to a civil case, if there's an accusation of IP theft, the companies involved must be able to prove the origin of the file, including who may have modified it and when the first revision was created, things like that.

Or it might be the case that it is both ineffective and immoral, but doesn't rise to the level of being worth adding legal interference in parenting.

I want to argue mostly against the third. I would guess that this probably *is* ineffective, and I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt that your parents were being unreasonable here (although, to be blunt, [your post history](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/w58squ/faux_news_mom_still_refusing_to_even_note_trump/ih8xoxw/) suggests you mighta been asking for it a little). But that's a far cry from something being illegal.

The fact is that no, you will not face any permanent harm from not seeing your friends for a month. I'm sure it won't be very fun, and it might even be unjust, but it isn't abuse in and of itself. And unless it's abuse - and pretty egregious abuse at that - both American and almost every other culture in the world affords parents enormous leeway in how they treat their children by both law and by tradition. This has been the case throughout the history of civilization and around the world, so it's pretty safe to say that a wide range of cultures have largely come to agreement on it.

That doesn't *in itself* make it correct, but it does raise the burden of proof: if you want to overturn thousands of years of global tradition, you better have a good reason! (Actually, we already have overturned some of that tradition, in that you *would* have legal recourse if your parents beat you. But this is nowhere near that level. That said, [apparently your parents *have* tried to beat you with a switch, and *that* is not okay at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/terriblefacebookmemes/comments/vz8e8s/the_mystery_of_disrespectful_kids_today_has_now/iga1zqr/).)

To give you an idea of why we should generally not get the law involved in parenting - and I'll stick to a nice topical liberal example for this, since you and I are on the same side politically - imagine that you were just across the border in Idaho. And imagine you're a gay kid, with accepting parents. How much would you enjoy the state getting involved and saying they can't support who you are? 

(This isn't *the same* thing, in that that would clearly be an action with different moral value, but one of the things we have to be careful about to some extent in law is that we establish legal principles that work well even when people we disagree with are in control of them. Or at least, that's normally important, current insane circumstances notwithstanding.)

---------

As for due process: due process applies to a punishment *by the government*. Your parents are not bound by the fourth or fifth amendments, because they are not punishing you through the legal system. For a more adult-world example, neither is your employer, who can absolutely punish you with probable cause even if they cannot prove things beyond a reasonable doubt. (If you were arrested then yes, you as a minor would still have a legal right to due process. But that's a different matter.)

---------

&gt; [from a comment] don't break the rules assumes the rules are morally right, and the process by which you were determined to have broken said rules is infallible.

Well, no, not necessarily. There is some value in the rule of law and in consistent behavior even when the rules are not perfect or when their enforcement is fallible.

---------

More generally, and I'm gonna be a little bit blunt with you here: you probably aren't as smart as you think you are, and even your (apparently genuinely pretty nuts) parents probably have some worthwhile things to teach you.

You've learned some things, and you're standing up for your beliefs. Those are good things (although as an adult I have to tell you that this thread is *adorable* and comes off as far more childish than you probably think it does). But you are only at the beginning of your understanding of the world, as evidenced by your...loose grasp of the legal principles of due process.

So when you, the brilliant mastermind tactician who will [reveal how your mom is dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/w58squ/faux_news_mom_still_refusing_to_even_note_trump/ih8xoxw/) go into an argument with her, (a) you're not the tactician you think you are and (b) you're picking a dumb fight that has no possible benefit to you. When you [start dropping 9/11 conspiracy theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/w4a97h/the_planes_were_planed/ih2sout/), you demonstrate that you rely too much on your own reasoning and not enough on the expertise of others.

OP, I am very, very smart. By any measure - whether you go by my test scores, my income, my measured IQ, whatever - I am in the top fraction of a percent of the population, and I've worked hard to cultivate that intelligence. And you know what I've learned as I have? That figuring shit out is **really, really hard**. I think as hard as I can about relatively mundane business problems for my job, I get it wrong *all the time*, and I'm still considered pretty good at my job because I'm right maybe 25% of the time instead of the background 10. The biggest thing I've learned is how *little* I know, and how cautious I must be outside of my areas of expertise (while still being willing to take my best guess when I can). And even then, I still fuck that up sometimes.

Are you smarter than your family? Yeah, maybe, but being smarter than a rural religious conservative Trump fanatic isn't particularly hard. It's a low bar, is what I'm saying, and seeing the errors in their logic doesn't make you immune to errors in your own. And this thread is a good example: you've taken a way in which you're personally pissed off, taken the things you (half-)know, and tried to assemble it into a Grand Logical Truth instead of just a thing you don't like very much.

All of this is normal for your age. And so is me, as an adult, telling you about it, because it's also normal to grow out of these things, mature, and figure out how to both *have* beliefs *and* limit your certainty in them. There's a saying you've probably heard that ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"", and that's what it means: it means that you don't know what you don't know, and are trying to extend and extrapolate what you know with far more confidence than you ought to have at your current level of understanding.",False

thats almost an ad hominem but I will ignore it as your arguments seem well intentioned 

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's start with your main post, which has three parts:  
Grounding a child for &gt;2 weeks is ineffective  
Grounding a child for &gt;2 weeks is morally wrong.  
and  
Grounding a child for &gt;2 weeks should be illegal.

you misinterpreted what I was trying to say:

ineffective not always

morally wrong not significantly so that it should be illegal

past two weeks all of those things come into question

appeal to tradition and popularity in place of argument:both American and almost every other culture in the world affords parents enormous leeway in how they treat their children by both law and by tradition. This has been the case throughout the history of civilization and around the world, so it's pretty safe to say that a wide range of cultures have largely come to agreement on it. you formed a statement of fact but did not elaborate on it or how it effectively supports your position aside from that that's how it is and has been. I do recognize however recognize how you elaborate on that here:That doesn't in itself make it correct, but it does raise the burden of proof: if you want to overturn thousands of years of global tradition, you better have a good reason! (Actually, we already have overturned some of that tradition, in that you would have legal recourse if your parents beat you. But this is nowhere near that level.

I would guess that this probably is ineffective, and I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt that your parents were being unreasonable here (although, to be blunt, your post history suggests you mighta been asking for it a little). But that's a far cry from something being illegal.

revenge for arguing in somebody's own terms is not morally right secondly this post is entirely separated from any conflict in particular even if it does not appear to be(you will just have to take my word on this as there is no sufficient evidence to prove either way)

my ogp could be extended to include the moral question of punitive action: should we give the accused an opportunity to defend themselves(the age of the accused is not relevant in this question as in the context that this is asked the accused are all equal).

To give you an idea of why we should generally not get the law involved in parenting - and I'll stick to a nice topical liberal example for this, since you and I are on the same side politically - imagine that you were just across the border in Idaho. And imagine you're a gay kid, with accepting parents. How much would you enjoy the state getting involved and saying they can't support who you are? this is a problem with the structural form of government and a lacking constitution at the current moment not a reason why the government should not be involved in parenting in any way, which is a complicated way of saying the changes necessary for policy's to go into effect without having unintended consequences are more than just those detailed in individual policy's of government.

As for due process: due process applies to a punishment by the government. Your parents are not bound by the fourth or fifth amendments, because they are not punishing you through the legal system. For a more adult-world example, neither is your employer, who can absolutely punish you with probable cause even if they cannot prove things beyond a reasonable doubt. (If you were arrested then yes, you as a minor would still have a legal right to due process. But that's a different matter.) this is of course true but forgets that your employer is not allowed to punish you in a way not detailed in a hiring contract or that is already illegal ie placing you under defacto house arrest or theft of possessions. secondly parents form a defacto government in relation to their child from which they should be protected(im not suggesting regulation of all punitive measure just grounding past a certain quantity, corporal punishment, and other negligibly beneficial punishments with excessive harm).

You've learned some things, and you're standing up for your beliefs. Those are good things (although as an adult I have to tell you that this thread is adorable and comes off as far more childish than you probably think it does). But you are only at the beginning of your understanding of the world, as evidenced by your...loose grasp of the legal principles of due process. this is a straight up ad hominem pick a better argument then my opposition is ignorant therefore his argument are worthless.

So when you, the brilliant mastermind tactician who will reveal how your mom is dumb go into an argument with her, (a) you're not the tactician you think you are and (b) you're picking a dumb fight that has no possible benefit to you. When you start dropping 9/11 conspiracy theories, you demonstrate that you rely too much on your own reasoning and not enough on the expertise of others. I never claimed myself a brilliant mastermind tactician. I enjoy the process of humiliating those that have cause me suffering so it has benefit to me. 9/11 is not relevant here but I just find myself skeptical of anything said by any authority and worth of questioning rather than automatic acceptance. I don't have any conclusions on those events aside from that it seems fishy upon close examination and I think the official story is ok until proven otherwise.

OP, I am very, very smart. By any measure - whether you go by my test scores, my income, my measured IQ, whatever - I am in the top fraction of a percent of the population, and I've worked hard to cultivate that intelligence. And you know what I've learned as I have? That figuring shit out is really, really hard.

The biggest thing I've learned is how little I know, and how cautious I must be outside of my areas of expertise (while still being willing to take my best guess when I can). And even then, I still fuck that up sometimes. this is why I enjoy the debate of complex subjects they are a test of intelligence and my ability to find flaws in reasoning.

Are you smarter than your family? Yeah, maybe, but being smarter than a rural religious conservative Trump fanatic isn't particularly hard. It's a low bar, is what I'm saying, and seeing the errors in their logic doesn't make you immune to errors in your own. And this thread is a good example: you've taken a way in which you're personally pissed off, taken the things you (half-)know, and tried to assemble it into a Grand Logical Truth instead of just a thing you don't like very much. partly true but this sub is all about the debate of views or opinions. next you have yet to point out a fundamental flaw or potential fundamental flaw(that I will not have a counter for or have not had a counter for) 

All of this is normal for your age. And so is me, as an adult, telling you about it, because it's also normal to grow out of these things, mature, and figure out how to both have beliefs and limit your certainty in them. There's a saying you've probably heard that ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"", and that's what it means: it means that you don't know what you don't know, and are trying to extend and extrapolate what you know with far more confidence than you ought to have at your current level of understanding. again the age of a participants of a debate is irrelevant. what is relevant is the is positions each side holds and the ways they support that. secondly it is possible to extrapolate all past and future data from a collection of all present data in a system to a very high certainty. therefore(regardless of the irrelevance of this point) the more I know the more I can extrapolate about the past future and present with growing certainty.

morally speaking there is no reason why suffering should be inflicted unnecessarily on the innocent I hope we can agree on that one thing",True

This is actually a pretty good example of your overuse of a relatively limited set of knowledge.

The fact is that, in practice, we rely on small observations all the time. You don't always have the luxury of a large sample size. Does that make you wrong sometimes? Yeah, sure, but sometimes it's the best you can do. And in this case, the data I have about you is basically just from your posting.

&gt; also I really don't see what role my personality holds in a debate

It speaks to your biases and motivations. Humans are not perfect logical machines, and it's hard to avoid the influence of the people we are even when we're aware of that fact and really trying not to. It's all the harder when you have strong feelings on the subject and an ego tied up in it (as you seem to here).

&gt; thats almost an ad hominem but I will ignore it as your arguments seem well intentioned 

I'm not arguing to someone else that you're wrong because of who you are (which could be an ad hominem, although there are cases where - say, because someone is clearly arguing in bad faith - the background of a debate participate is relevant).

I'm trying to explain to *you* why *you* are wrong, and in order to do that, I need to help you understand the influence of parts of yourself that I don't think you see very well.

&gt; appeal to tradition and popularity in place of argument

Not in place of, but as a starting point.

No, the generality of a belief isn't a *guarantee* that it's true, but it's awfully good reason to think that it is. If you've got one person who thinks they've outsmarted the whole world, 99.9999% of the time, they are wrong. I don't even think that number is exaggerated: the number of people who can beat the whole world, even in their areas of expertise, is *really really small*.

&gt; revenge for arguing in somebody's own terms is not morally right

Well, one, I don't necessarily trust your reports here to not be a little self-serving. We are only getting your side, and again, based on the way you tend to talk, I'm gonna guess that you *were* being kind of a dick.

And for two, as previously established, we're distinguishing morality and legality here.

&gt;  secondly this post is entirely separated from any conflict in particular even if it does not appear to be(you will just have to take my word on this as there is no sufficient evidence to prove either way)

Well, no point debating it further, but idontbelieveyou.png

&gt; my ogp could be extended to include the moral question of punitive action: should we give the accused an opportunity to defend themselves(the age of the accused is not relevant in this question as in the context that this is asked the accused are all equal).

Sure, your parents probably should give you an opportunity to defend yourself, but again, that doesn't rise to any legal standard.

&gt; this is a problem with the structural form of government and a lacking constitution at the current moment not a reason why the government should not be involved in parenting in any way

Well, maybe, but we don't get to make policy in an ideal world where the government works exactly as we'd like it to, we have to make policy in *this* world in which we actually live. ""My thing would work perfectly if &lt;everything else were idealized&gt;"" is a really common and almlost entirely useless form of argument, because everything else never *is* idealized.

&gt; this is of course true but forgets that your employer is not allowed to punish you in a way not detailed in a hiring contract

Er...yes, they absolutely are. Your employer can fire you for almost any reason they like, with a few legally-protected exceptions (like your gender or race).

&gt; or that is already illegal ie placing you under defacto house arrest or theft of possessions.

No, because your employer does not have legal custody over you. Your parents, however, do, and those actions are within their custody rights.

&gt; secondly parents form a defacto government in relation to their child from which they should be protected

Well, maybe should, but aren't except in cases of gross abuse. Even if you want to argue they are a government, they're not one formed under the terms of the Constitution and its provisions don't apply to them.

&gt; this is a straight up ad hominem pick a better argument then my opposition is ignorant therefore his argument are worthless.

I've already explained why your arguments are incorrect. I'm trying to explain to you, as a person, why you are coming to those incorrect arguments - and how you can grow to have better ones.

&gt; I never claimed myself a brilliant mastermind tactician. I enjoy the process of humiliating those that have cause me suffering so it has benefit to me.

Remember when I said earlier that you were probably being kind of a dick? This is what I meant. What the hell did you think was gonna happen when you set out to ""humiliate"" the people who have significant control over your life? Not exactly a galaxy-brain move.

&gt; 9/11 is not relevant here but I just find myself skeptical of anything said by any authority and worth of questioning rather than automatic acceptance.

Yeah, that's a bad idea, is what I'm saying. Like yes, you should be *willing* to doubt such claims given good reason to do so, but ""authority said it so it's 50-50 whether it's true"" is a dumb approach that will make you wrong far more often than you're right.

&gt; again the age of a participants of a debate is irrelevant.

I don't think that's true. It doesn't automatically make the elder right and the younger person wrong, of course, but - well, remember a bit up this post when I was talking about how a person's background informs how they approach things and what biases they bring to the table?

The fundamental bias of youth is oversimplifying. You haven't had an opportunity to observe the ways in which rigid principles often fail in different situations, or to see just how complicated the patterns that make up the world are. That makes you overconfident in simple solutions. It doesn't mean you shouldn't look for solutions, or that you have nothing to contribute, it means you should take that bias into account when you do so.

&gt; secondly it is possible to extrapolate all past and future data from a collection of all present data in a system to a very high certainty.

It really isn't, even with exceptionally good data (more than you are likely in practice to ever have).

Most real-world systems are chaotic. That means (to oversimplify a bit) that errors in measurement grow exponentially over time. This is especially true of human systems, because a system that is well-understood tends to be exploited - and therefore have its dynamics changed - by the people who understand it. In other words, a social system that is well-understood tends to be unstable, meaning that social systems actively *avoid* comprehensibility by the individuals that comprise them.

&gt; therefore(regardless of the irrelevance of this point) the more I know the more I can extrapolate about the past future and present with growing certainty.

Well, let me put it this way: if you can predict things with such certainty, pick some small problem - say, on the scale of 50 or 100 people - and try to solve it through that predictive ability, with no excuses for failure (you don't get to go ""but if other people would just-"", for example). I think you'll be surprised at how challenging you find it.

&gt; morally speaking there is no reason why suffering should be inflicted unnecessarily on the innocent I hope we can agree on that one thing

ok with that out of the way:

I understand how you are trying to help me understand why I am wrong thus the purpose of extrapolation of my personality from post history

It speaks to your biases and motivations. Humans are not perfect logical machines, and it's hard to avoid the influence of the people we are even when we're aware of that fact and really trying not to. It's all the harder when you have strong feelings on the subject and an ego tied up in it (as you seem to here).

I'm trying to explain to you why you are wrong, and in order to do that, I need to help you understand the influence of parts of yourself that I don't think you see very well. in a debate I am attempting to completely silence those parts and so unless a direct falsehood is stated or flaw in logic is observed to be caused by a bias then the inherent bias of the person is irrelevant. of course im arguing my position from a minors point of view so I of course could directly serve to potentially benefit from the installment of a policy as describe in my ogp a bias I am aware of. unless that bias causes a falsehood or fallacy to be argued then it is managed and not relevant. coincidentally looking at a list of logical fallacy this fall nicely into an appeal to motive.

I concede this point I incorrectly interpreted this part of your position:Not in place of, but as a starting point.  
No, the generality of a belief isn't a guarantee that it's true, but it's awfully good reason to think that it is. If you've got one person who thinks they've outsmarted the whole world, 99.9999% of the time, they are wrong.

Sure, your parents probably should give you an opportunity to defend yourself, but again, that doesn't rise to any legal standard. this right here seems to be the core of the debate, the place of disagreement. I believe the necessary severity for any punishment to be given legal consideration is lower and from my interpretation of your arguments you believe it is higher than my base. I believe this could be resolved quite simply, for groundings over 2 weeks an appeal is submitted requiring an unbiased third party(not necessarily a judge just an unbiased(unbiased as maximally possible) third party) and a jury of peers of the accused in low number maybe 10 or 12 maximum. the accused defends themselves no lawyer necessary presents evidence. the prosecution(the parents) presents counter evidence and a conclusion is reached resulting in a chosen sentence or none at all. this could be accomplished with the school system for the selection of the third party and jury. this sort of system could help kids prepare for the real world by allowing an environment in which they can practice defending themselves sudo legally. the number of groundings over 2 weeks would likely decrease as the process becomes more lengthy.

Remember when I said earlier that you were probably being kind of a dick? This is what I meant. What the hell did you think was gonna happen when you set out to ""humiliate"" the people who have significant control over your life? Not exactly a galaxy-brain move. don't care was totally worth it. ie the consequences were less than the reward for me.

Yeah, that's a bad idea, is what I'm saying. Like yes, you should be willing to doubt such claims given good reason to do so, but ""authority said it so it's 50-50 whether it's true"" is a dumb approach that will make you wrong far more often than you're right. I argued insufficiently here. I meant that everything said by authority should be examined not blanketly stated as unlikely because it was said by authority.

Well, maybe, but we don't get to make policy in an ideal world where the government works exactly as we'd like it to, we have to make policy in this world in which we actually live. ""My thing would work perfectly if &lt;everything else were idealized&gt;"" is a really common and almlost entirely useless form of argument, because everything else never is idealized. true but that assumes the conditions in which my policy works must be perfect and cannot be flawed to work.

I don't think that's true. It doesn't automatically make the elder right and the younger person wrong, of course, but - well, remember a bit up this post when I was talking about how a person's background informs how they approach things and what biases they bring to the table? worth considering but not overriding of logic in an appeal to motive which now that I think about it you kinda already said.

It really isn't, even with exceptionally good data (more than you are likely in practice to ever have).  
Most real-world systems are chaotic. That means (to oversimplify a bit) that errors in measurement grow exponentially over time.

Well, let me put it this way: if you can predict things with such certainty, pick some small problem - say, on the scale of 50 or 100 people - and try to solve it through that predictive ability, with no excuses for failure (you don't get to go ""but if other people would just-"", for example).

ihd6nxn,breckenridgeback,"&gt; but any argument with a correct conclusion reached through a flawed mechanism of argument the same conclusion can also be reached with an unflawed argument. because of this I will disregard any argument containing any flaws in logic with a response naming the type of fallacy it contains if it is blatantly obvious to contain an example of a textbook fallacy.

Fallacies - and their overzealous application - are not the be-all and end-all of logical reasoning.

&gt; biases and motivations are subservient to a logical argument and should be treated as such deal with the logic first biases and motivations second.

Actual conversations like the ones we're engaged in are subject to lots of interpretation between the argument itself and its formal structure.

For example:

* People should have freedom and rights (proposition P)
* It's important to guide children to correct behavior (proposition Q)
* Grounding children for a month is a good idea (proposition R)

You could easily write something like P -&gt; not R, or Q -&gt; R. But that's not really embedding the full logical connective tissue, because the statement P -&gt; not R requires a bunch of additional statements (namely that grounding children is a violation of freedom or rights), and in fact the fact that everyone already agrees proposition P isn't universal to begin with. Similarly, Q -&gt; R contains underlying statements like ""grounding children effectively changes their behavior"", and ignores the fact that Q itself is not absolute.

Reasoning in the real world tends to fail for those connective reasons as much or more than it does because of formal fallacies. Everyone agrees that \exists x | x \in S does not imply \forall x | x \in S, but that's not usually the point of failure. The choice of characterization matters a lot, as do the input facts.

&gt; of course im arguing my position from a minors point of view so I of course could directly serve to potentially benefit from the installment of a policy as describe in my ogp a bias I am aware of. unless that bias causes a falsehood or fallacy to be argued then it is managed and not relevant. 

I mean, it has - among other things, you've (falsely) claimed that the due process provisions of the Constitution apply to parental treatment.

&gt; coincidentally looking at a list of logical fallacy this fall nicely into an appeal to motive.

_frustrated head pounding into desk_

Your argument wasn't a logical one in the first place. You're arguing *from*, and as a result of, that motive. The motive is highly relevant.

&gt; bad faith. secondly arguing in kind with somebody who argues in bad faith is equivalent and thus net neutral gain or loss if you are more skilled with word than them then that is their personal problem. 

I'm not following this bit.

I don't think you're here in bad faith. Presenting a biased account that you don't *know* it biased isn't bad faith.

&gt; note the golden rule here treat people how you want to be treated and so if my parent argues in a condescending manner about anything than it is not morally wrong to do the same in the same time.

The golden rule does not say that retaliation is ethical. It's a guide for *your* actions, not someone else's. [Lex talionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye) is ancient law, not modern ethics, and it is absolutely possible for *both* people in a conflict to be assholes.

&gt; this right here seems to be the core of the debate, the place of disagreement.

Well, yes.

&gt; I believe the necessary severity for any punishment to be given legal consideration is lower

Then I don't think you know the law very well. And I sincerely doubt this is a claim you've made any effort to verify. You spend any time skimming through Washington State family law and precedent? I'm betting not.

&gt; I believe this could be resolved quite simply, for groundings over 2 weeks an appeal is submitted requiring an unbiased third party(not necessarily a judge just an unbiased(unbiased as maximally possible) third party) and a jury of peers of the accused in low number maybe 10 or 12 maximum.

This is, to put it mildly, grossly impractical. (Also, ""jury of peers""? Are you trying to create juries of frustrated teenagers here?)

&gt; the number of groundings over 2 weeks would likely decrease as the process becomes more lengthy.

Yeah, and this is where we get at some of the heart of what you're about. You're not looking for due process, you're looking for extra burden to produce the outcome you want. Imagine, say, that there weren't any logical hassle to the parents in bringing such a ""case"", so that it creates no burden to imposing such punishments. Would that change your opinion of whether it's a good idea?

&gt; don't care was totally worth it. ie the consequences were less than the reward for me.

Then stop complaining about the consequences, lol.

&gt; I argued insufficiently here. I meant that everything said by authority should be examined not blanketly stated as unlikely because it was said by authority.

Such ""examination"" is more likely to produce a false positive from something you don't understand than a true positive where you identify a problem with it, at least in cases where the claim is coming from experts who have devoted proper study to the subject. This sort of reasoning is what leads to the 1 x 1 = 2 guy.

&gt; true but that assumes the conditions in which my policy works must be perfect and cannot be flawed to work.

Your policy would certainly not work within the current legal system.

Assuming that parents, on average, impose such a punishment 5 times through a child's upbringing (which I think is roughly what it would work out to if you looked at my own childhood? I don't have a great number, but let's use it to ballpark). Let's say the ""trial"" takes one work day, with a jury of 12 and some form of skilled-labor administrator (like a judge).

That is, per trial, something like 12 (jurors) \* $14.49 (WA state min wage) \* 8 hours (workday) = about $1,400. Judges are highly educated, but let's assume it's just a random administrator who makes, say, $50 an hour on average, that adds another $50 \* 8 = $400, for $1800 total. You've got administrative costs to file and keep track of results - those are hard to estimate, so I'm going to bake them into rounding up to $2000.

Times five times during a child's upbringing is $10,000 of extra rearing costs per child. There are [83,101](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/Pubs/422-099-2020-2010-VitalStatHighlights.pdf) live births in WA state per year, most of whom survive to adulthood, meaning that this amounts to an extra cost of around $800 million annually. That means you're devoting about 3% of WA state's *total* tax revenue to disputes over grounding children.

ihcvbri,Castriff,"&gt;What will change my view is someone either pointing out a flaw in my logic and proving my statement is wrong, or proving that using our free will to choose to believe in God is not a requirement for a majority of Christian denominations.

I think the primary issue with your argument is a misconception about the definitions of ""faith"" and ""free will"" (or, perhaps more accurately, incomplete definitions of those things). I am not blaming you for this, though, because I think a *lot* of Christian denominations have lost track of these. This is what I believe: choosing to believe in God is a requirement for Christian denominations, but *not* a requirement for being right with God Himself.

You say that it was taught to you that ""Our faith in God is our free will."" I disagree. ""Free will"" and ""faith"" are not synonymous. Faith in God is an expression of free will. Our ability to make choices does indicate free will, but in that sense believing in God is just as much an expression of free will as not believing in Him. 

Faith, though, is not *only* belief in God, but also commitment to Him. It's a choice to follow what He tells us, and most importantly, to have a relationship with Him. When the Bible says ""we are saved by faith, not works,"" that means salvation is a result of striving to be righteous rather than only doing good actions. It is entirely possible to believe in God and then reject Him after the fact by intentionally choosing to ignore His influence through the Holy Spirit. Satan is the primary example, as someone else already mentioned, as when he was an angel he had the opportunity to talk to God on a daily basis. (Incidentally, this is also evidence that angels *do* have free will, not just humans.) It's also possible for a person to have a positive relationship with God without believing in God, simply by following one's conscience and trying to be a good person. All these things are also expressions of free will. So in that sense, certainty of God's existence doesn't negate the existence of faith. There's more that comes after that isn't necessarily implied by or connected to the former. 

I also think that it's flat-out wrong to say that ""bad things happening to good people"" or ""unanswered prayers"" or ""a lack of miracles"" are a result of God needing to build faith through the absence of blessings or evidence. God will give every human the opportunity to be righteous (again, even if they don't believe in Him) and faith in that sense might be tested during difficult times, but it increases because God gives reason and evidence to believe in His goodness *despite* the negative effects of sin in the world. 

Hopefully this makes sense. It's not exactly a majority view, but I do think it's well backed by the Bible.",False

As some background, I've always been a little confused about this.  I see people say, ""I can't just make myself believe something,"" and that's never made much sense to me. 

It might be useful to get into the nature of a belief... what do you think that is?",False
ihd6370,Sleepycoon,"The bulk of my post was me trying to dissuade people who would give me the basic canned responses to someone saying they don't believe in God that I've heard my whole life. I also typed this up at 3:00 in the morning when I couldn't sleep, so some of it is less coherent than I would have liked for it to have been. I feel like my loss of Faith wasn't a choice because it's something that happened naturally with no direct input from me. There was not a single defining moment where I chose to stop believing and at no point that I choose to seek to lose my belief, I just reached a point where that is how I felt and I could not make myself feel any different. I'm generalizing it out because I've spoken to a lot of other people who have had similar experiences and it doesn't seem like a situation unique to me by any means.

This line of reasoning was actually started by another post that somebody made a similar point by telling a story where a Christian didn't believe them when they said that they couldn't just choose to believe in God and they explained it to the Christian by asking the Christian if they could, right then on the spot consciously choose to genuinely stop believing in god. It was, of course, impossible for the Christian because God is a genuinely held belief and they can't just turn that off and on like a light switch, and the moral of the story was the same was true for the atheists lack of belief.

For the purposes of this view I define belief as trust that something is real despite a lack of evidence and/or evidence to the contrary. I use belief and Faith somewhat interchangeably, but if I were to differentiate them I would say that faith is trust that something is not only real, but true, despite a lack of evidence and/or evidence to the contrary.

There's something that I didn't really touch on in my post but I think causes this disconnect I see so much, and I think this is a good example.

I believe that some people have the capacity to genuinely truly believe things despite a lack of evidence or evidence to the contrary, and I believe some people don't. I think there have been studies done on this that found genetic markers that highlighted someone's likelihood to believe in a religion and what political party people are likely to be associated with and things like that, I don't remember the details so I don't want to base my argument of that, and I don't know if it's genetic or neurological or something else, but I think some people simply have the capacity and some people don't.

The way my brain is wired, and I should specify this isn't unique to me, I have spoken to a lot of other people who feel the same way that I do, when I say I can't just make myself believe something I mean if I sat a bright red apple in front of you and told you to believe that it was blue, could you? You could tell me you think it's blue, you could maybe squint and tilt your head and decide that maybe in the right lighting somebody could perceive it as more purplish than red, but could you genuinely look at a bright red apple and actually convince yourself that the apple is bright blue? If we were standing in the field at high noon could you genuinely make yourself believe it was the dead of night? I can't. And for me making myself genuinely believe in the judeo-christian god of the Bible feels just as impossible as making myself believe that the red apple is blue.

You might just be wired differently and have the capacity to believe, and for you and people like you it makes sense to think that everyone feels the same way you do. And for me and people like me it makes sense to think everyone feels the same way we do. I think this is why when theists and atheists argue no ground is really ever made and the atheists all act like the theists must be blatantly lying to themselves because how else could they possibly believe something with so much evidence stacked against it, and the theists always act like the atheists must secretly believe and just be lying for fame or power or to rebel against God because there's no other logical explanation for denying his existence.

If my theory is true and not everyone has the capacity to believe in god, then the concept that everyone has a chance at salvation can't be true. How can I choose salvation when my brain is hardwired to not accept God as reality?",True
ihdah7d,PreacherJudge,"&gt; I believe that some people have the capacity to genuinely truly believe things despite a lack of evidence or evidence to the contrary, and I believe some people don't.

This capacity is just called ""imagination.""  And yes, imaginative capacity absolutely varies across people.

...but I suspect you bristled when I called this imagination, and I think the reason might be in this ""truly believe"" term you used.  As in, the person has to imagine and then to forget they're using your imagination, or something like that.

But this was my point in asking about beliefs, because I think you might be smuggling a lot into the definition, and teasing all that out would be helpful.  So using your phrasing, I'll clarify I'm asking about what you mean when you say ""a trust that something is real.""  

Here's one specific aspect, in case it'll help communication.  Do you think beliefs *necessitate action*?  In other words, if I bite into the apple as if it was just an ordinary apple, then I couldn't have ""truly believed"" it was blue (and thus probably artificial)?",False

ihjrczb,timberlin,"Pilot, here, so I'll see what I can do.....

**Lack of Control**

I can absolutely empathize with this feeling.  What I can say are the individuals in control of a commercial airliner are some of the most experienced aviators on the planet who have undergone years of rigorous training to get to the point that you cross paths.  They are significantly more skilled at operating their machinery than the average driver out on the road.  For whatever reason, driving an automobile doesn't garner the fear and respect it should, so everyone takes it for granted.  Think of how many distracted drivers there are out on the road, who at any time can slam into your car with no chance for reaction on your end.  Though you are controlling YOUR car, you are not controlling theirs, so in a very practical sense, you are not nearly in as much control of your fate as you might prefer to be.  A question I would ask you though, is do you feel the same discomfort riding passenger in an automobile as you do a plane?

**Flying in Inclement Weather**

Your concern is completely warranted as severe weather can very easily take a plane down and is often a root cause in aviation mishaps; however, for that reason, it is equally a concern for those flying the plane.  Before every flight, I can assure you that your pilot has thoroughly reviewed the forecast throughout the route of flight, as well as over a wide time range to account for delays.  If too dangerous and unable to avoid this weather, aircrews may alter the route of flight, amend take-off windows to slip into a safer line, or choose altogether to not enter into a region of severe weather.  If this doesn't put your mind at ease, commercial airlines have incredibly sophisticated onboard weather radars to provide real-time updates as the flight progresses.  This is further backed up by ground weather radar systems that are relayed up to the pilot by Air Traffic Control (ATC) to further expand the picture to the pilots.  On the rare occasion that these systems are not able to provide adequate information, pilots will often report unexpected conditions to ATC through something called a PIREP (pilot report), so this information can be relayed to other aircraft in the area.  Lastly, and most importantly, don't discount eyeballs and experience.  With the thousands of hours under their belts, commercial pilots are not stupid and will not fly directly into a cumulonimbus that they see off the nose, regardless of what a radar picture says.

**Airborne Emergencies**

This is something I would say should be the furthest from your worries.  The image of flaming aviation wreckage triggers really visceral emotions deep within nearly everyone.  I won't continue to pound the drum of statistics in this regard, but you need to understand that catastrophic aviation emergencies are effectively a rounding error.   Safety is paramount in everything we do in aviation.  If there is an accident, panels of experts deep dive into every root cause, this information is processed, and then it is presented to the larger aviation community.  From there, we study it extensively, learn from those mistakes, aligning policy, design, and training to prevent similar mistakes from occurring again.  Because of this culture, our processes for handling emergencies are well laid out.  Aircraft are equipped with countless sensors and automation to attempt prevent failures altogether, but at a minimum, present this information quickly to the pilots to act.  Aircraft undergo maintenance and inspections at a much more frequent clip than anything you have experienced with automobiles.  On top of this, pilots are trained extensively on their equipment and we have access to thousands of pages of technical documentation and checklists in the air to help us work through any equipment failures.  I don't say this to scare you, but it is very likely that you have been on a flight with an emergency, but the safety redundancies in design and well laid out procedural guidance quickly and quietly solved the problems with you being none the wiser.  On the chance that none of this fixes the issue and a expedited landing needs to occur, emergency aircraft have complete priority in the air.  ATC opens the Red Sea, pushing any potential conflicts in the air out of the way to minimize air time for the emergency aircraft.

But I wouldn't want to live there anyway. In Sweden, I'll have access to healthcare regardless of my job. If I want to take a job at a small company - or even if I become unemployed - I'll never have to pay more than like $30 to go to the ER and have whatever treatments required for whatever happened. I'll never have to pay more than $120 for healthcare per year *at all*, because that's the maximum you pay. Nor will I have to witness the struggles of friends and family who just cannot afford it.

I could come down with diabetes, and know that I will get insulin for free. If I got HIV, I'd get HIV meds for free.

I'm not planning on having children, but if I did, I wouldn't have to save money for their college fund, because education doesn't cost anything.

I also know that regardless of where I work, I will always be legally entitled to 25 paid vacation days per year, and a legal right to 11 hours of consecutive daily rest and 36 hours of consecutive weekly rest. I'll have unlimited sick days as well.

And regardless of where I work, there's always a hard cap on how much ordered overtime you can work - for instance, never more than an average of 48 hours over 4 weeks, unless there's some kind of force majeure (like a pandemic for healthcare workers).

And even though my salary is lower than in the US, I make significantly more than the median income. So much more that I can work at reduced hours, have a day off every other week, and *still* make much more than the median salary.

Also, I don't even have a driver's license, which seems to be something that you much more frequently need in the US than here.

&gt;Btw what is the point of having so much free weeks in a year while your wage will not allow you to travel as much and as hard as americans do in a few days

Most Swedes do? I've been abroad twice in the last two months. A lot of people go abroad in the Summer, to places like Spain or Greece. Going abroad 1-3 per year is super common among ""professionals"".

Most of the folks in my hometown are Christians, so when some of my peers heard that, they wanted to try to save me. They weren’t “rude” about it, but as an inherent cultural difference, I personally take attempts to “save me” as insulting.

The fact is that a lot of people have not-so-great opinions about religious people and religions because of personal experiences they’ve had. My public high school fought same sex prom dates and only dropped it after the second time they got sued by the ACLU.

I was also born with XY chromosomes, and I hated being a man and desperately wanted to be a woman. My experience is different from yours.

&gt; [from comments]  To me that suggests that, for example a trans-man was born a woman with a more masculine brain structure.

There is good, though not ironclad, evidence to suggest that this is the case:

* Trans status is heavily correlated with conditions that create hormone abnormalities in the womb, but
* is *not*, conditional on that, correlated with hormone levels as an adult
* There are strong genetic factors, with twins of trans people orders of magnitude more likely than the general public to be trans
* Markers of prenatal hormone exposure, like digit ratio, correlate strongly with trans status. (My digit ratio, for example, would be three-something standard deviations out of the male range.)
* The David Reimer case shows, at least anecdotally, that if you raise a physiologically normal boy as a girl, you see behavior patterns very similar to those shown by trans men.
* Direct studies of trans peoples' brains find patterns typical of their identified, not birth, sex, at least in some respects
* SNPs that screw with testosterone receptors are strongly correlated with being a trans woman
* Complete androgen insensitivity, which causes the body to be unreceptive to testosterone, almost invariably results in a female gender identity (exceptions exist but they are extremely rare)
* PCOS is strongly correlated with being a trans man
* and when you mess with hormones at specific points in fetal development in rats, you get male rats with female behavioral patterns and vice-versa

The dictionary definition would state that a sandwich is ""an item consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal."" However, this definition conflicts greatly with what society at large would refer to as a sandwich. Many sandwiches are made in such a way that the pieces of bread are not cut all the way apart, so it could be argued that those are not actually sandwiches since that would technically be one piece of bread and not two. If you do decide to include these sandwiches then now you also have to include hot dogs as sandwiches because its meat between bread, thus fitting the definition of sandwich. To take it a step further, what even is bread? Looking at the definition, its ""food made of flour, water, and yeast or another leavening agent, mixed together and baked"". Using that definition tortillas certainly fall under the category of bread and thus Quesadillas fall under the category of sandwich as they contain cheese between two pieces of ""bread"". This definition of sandwich could also be said to not include many typical sandwiches, particularly the hamburger, as it says sandwiches are a light meal where it could certainly be argued that things like burgers are not light in the slightest.

Descriptivists would say that words don't have to be use the exact way they are defined as long as the person you are communicating with understands what you mean, whereas prescriptivists would say that language should only be used in accordance to a strict set of rules (I think anyways, I'm not a linguist myself so feel free to correct that if necessary). Anyways, in the modern day most linguists tend to be in favour of descriptive language because, as illustrated by the sandwich point, prescriptive language tends to fall apart rather quickly when looked at too hard. So it really doesn't matter if the definition of woman is ""someone who identifies as a woman"" because that is the only definition of woman which includes all women and is therefore the best definition. It doesn't matter that the definition is circular because most nouns are or should be when you look into it. Sandwich was just one example I gave but there are plenty, the definition for book includes magazines and the current definition of human is already ""a human being, especially a person as distinguished from in animal or (in science fiction) an alien"" That definition is completely circular because to be any more specific would inevitably not include some group of humans. But thats ok because we don't need a hyper specific definition for humans because we can simply understand what is and is not human, similarly to how we just understand what is and is not a sandwich, is and is not a book, and is and is not a woman. A woman is someone who identifies as a woman, and thats as specific as the definition needs to be because if someone is using the word woman you can just know that they're using it to refer to someone that it adequately describes. Similarly to how you just know what I'm talking about when I say sandwich, book, or human despite their less than specific definitions",False
iho35n7,MostlyVacuum,"I'm familiar with the ""is a hot dog a sandwich"" argument about definitions, and I couldn't disagree more. I'm a radical ingredient anarchist -- a hot dog is a sandwich, a taco is a sandwich, a pop tart is a sandwich. It's sandwiches all the way down.",True
ihski25,Purple171717,"You misunderstand, the point of that was not to say a hotdog is not a sandwich, it was to point out that while society at large would not casually refer to one as a sandwich it is still, likely unintentionally, included in the current definition. So currently if two people were to argue about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich, they would both be correct just in different ways. To use the the same terms as before, one would be right based on prescriptivism, while the other would be correct based on descriptivism. Since both are perfectly valid arguments the two would never reach any sort of conclusion, thus muddling the communication process which is the exact opposite of what language as a concept strives to achieve. It is only with the more circular definition that this problem is solved. For example, lets say sandwich was defined as ""an object referred to by two or more people as a sandwich."" While still not perfect, it does now allow for both mindsets about what is and is not a sandwich to coexist. Now, a hot dog is only a sandwich if both people communicating agree that it is a sandwich, thus eliminating any confusion or hinderance to the communication process that was previously there. Society at large will likely continue to refer to the same old things as sandwiches, now without greatly reduced confusion, and small subsets can still refer to agreed upon items as sandwiches without being incorrect so long as they all understand what the others are talking about. So I continue to fail to understand what the problem is with something having a circular definition when really it acts as a great solution to many linguistic problems. It only seems like a bad idea because the human brain likes to think that everything can be sorted into neat little boxes with perfect boundaries, but the reality is that almost nothing can be put into these boxes. I mentioned previously that the current definition of Human is already circular and likely has been for awhile, and no one noticed or cared(as far as I know anyways) because it really is the best definition. There is no one defining trait shared across all humans, similarly to how there is no one defining trait between all women, men, or even sandwiches. When it comes to ideas and complex and variable as this circular definitions truly work best, as demonstrated by the definition of human. No one cared about that definition being circular, and yet for some reason the word woman or man being defined similarly is sparking a national debate, so while the supposed problem people have is the circular definition, the only real problem many of them have with it is that it makes a step towards including trans people rather than ostracising them. Not to say that why you believe this, the ""circular definitions are bad"" thing sounds reasonable and logical at first, but thats why I've attempted to illustrate that they aren't necessarily bad so you can see the real reason many people say this. And you know what, while I'm here I might as well bring this up. I believe I saw in another comment that you mentioned the reason you believe the concept of being trans to be a mental illness is because of a hatred of the current body caused by gender dysphoria. This seems to imply that dysphoria is an inherent part of being trans, which is simply not the case. Being trans is defined by euphoria, not dysphoria. It is the happiness brought about by expressing another gender identity that makes someone trans, not necessarily the sadness caused by their current one. Many people who are transfemme or transmasc may simply prefer expressing themselves as the other gender but not hate the one they were assigned at birth. And while I don't know as much about these identities, it seems to me that many demi-boys, demi-girls, and other people who express more androgynous gender identities may already feel their body matches the way they want to look and simply want to make changes to their day to day life. And I definitely don't know enough about neogenders to attempt to explain their relationship with gender dysphoria, although that doesn't make them any less valid I just personally don't know much about them. So there are plenty of examples of trans people who aren't unhappy with the body they were born in, so I don't really see how this could be called a mental illness. I hope this helped explain some points you seemed confused on, and hope you have a nice day",False
ihsu271,MostlyVacuum,"No, I knew what you meant I was just being glib. I meant to convey that I don't generally agree that your circular definition for sandwich is ""better"" than the prescriptivist definition.

The general purpose of a definition is to describe a thing to somebody who doesn't know what it is already. ""A sandwich is anything that people agree is a sandwich"" is certainly a true statement, but it isn't a definition because if I didn't know what a sandwich was already, it wouldn't tell me anything about a sandwich. A sandwich might be a car or an ostrich by that definition, but I wouldn't know because it relies on external knowledge.

Similarly ""a woman is anyone who identifies as a woman"" is not a good definition. It might be a true statement, but that doesn't make it a definition. It's also not even a true statement because I, as a cis man, could theoretically just lie and say ""I identify as a woman"". So in order to make the new definition even accurate we have to specify ""a woman is anyone who truthfully identifies as a woman"". This is a more true statement, but it's even worse as a definition! Now a person who doesn't know what a woman is has to find a person that professes to identify as a woman and then make a judgement call as to whether they're lying or not. It's a damn mess.

As to dysphoria being a mental illness, I have already awarded a delta for changing my view on this. I am curious about this ""gender euphoria"" you mention, can you expand on that?",True
ihsw0xo,Purple171717,"Firstly, I'd like to bring up I wouldn't say dictionary definitions are how we typically explain simpler concepts like sandwich, women, man, or human. I don't recall ever being taught exactly what a sandwich was or looking that word up in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure concepts such as that were taught by people pointing at pictures and saying things like ""this is a sandwich and this is not"" but thats as far as I'll expand on that right now as I feel this definition argument is growing repetitive and isn't really going anywhere. As for the concept of gender euphoria, I'd be happy to expand on that. It's really something fairly simply, its the term used to refer to the happiness felt by expressing the gender identity which you can identify with. Its hard to be mire specific than that as what causes gender euphoria varies from person to person and identity to identity. It can come from simple things like wearing gender affirming clothing or using gender affirming pronouns or it can come from slightly more drastic things like hormones and surgery. Every person who identifies as anything under the trans umbrella feels some kind of gender euphoria when they do certain gender affirming things (as far as I know anyways), whereas not everyone under that umbrella feels the gender dysphoria typically associated with being trans. Though not an expert on the subject, I'm fairly certain the reason its defined by euphoria rather than dysphoria is not only because of the identities mentioned in my previous comment but also because a cis person expressing their gender identity in a way besides the one assigned at birth wouldn't feel that euphoria, whereas a trans person would feel euphoria even if they've never felt dysphoria before. I hope that helps to explain it as thats the best I can do with a general overview. If you have more specific questions I may be able to answer them but as mentioned previously I'm not an expert on the subject so what I've said above is most of what I know",False

I disagree with you on No. 2. Abortion rights  have a majority of support in all the polling I've seen. The support isn't for totally unrestricted abortion, but, abortion with some limits on it is the majority position, Abortion only in cases of rape and incest is not the majority position. 

A democrat in a red area may benifit from being pro-life, but it depends on where that person is running, so as a local tactic, I agree, but as a matter of national policy the party should stay pro choice, my bet is the abortion issue is a good one for democrats going into November and beyond.

In my opinion a large part of the Republican party is playing footsy with a movement that is anti-democratic, and I don't mean democeratic party, I mean anti-democracy, which is very bad, and the democrats and the moderate Republicans should say that, because not saying it when it is true is enabling it.

You are correct, I have largely switched terminology over the course of this thread from ""gender identity"" to ""innate gender identity"" because many, many people have been conflating gender identity with gender expression or with cultural gender norms, and these are not the same thing.

The reason that I believe gender identity is typically defined as fixed at birth and unaffected by social norms, is because I have seen it defined that way over and over again, in many threads on this forum, as well as in other discussion forums, by people who are either trans or otherwise claim to have some expertise in modern gender theory. When I have seen it defined like this, I have very rarely seen pushback from other trans people in the thread. These kinds of definition comments are frequently top comments in their thread, with many replies from other trans people and gender theorists confirming that this is a good definition.

It is usually defined that way in contrast to gender expression, which comprises the part of gender that people externally display to others, and societal gender norms, which is exactly what it sounds like.

Their lived are not just constant suffering, their lives are complicated and worthwhile things. Ask them about it sometime. Disabled people are often quite happy, and even if they were not, its no one else's business whether or not disabled people are allowed to exist.

Even beyond that, your idea of a ""limited"" eugenics is still a fantasy and a mistake. Enabling a hierarchical structure with the ability to decide who deserves to reproduce and who does not will invariably end in tragedy and great evil. In your soft-eugenics, who gets to decide which people get to reproduce? The government? Do you trust the government, any government, to make consistently smart and informed decisions about who lives and dies, or who gets to reproduce?

No eugenics are moral eugenics. Even if you claim you want only a limited eugenics which eliminate painful conditions, enabling any authority with the power to decide who gets to reproduce and who doesn't, who gets to exist and who doesn't, invariably ends in fascist tendencies.

What gives a bunch of able-bodied people the right and authority to decide what disabilities qualify for this? What gives you or I the right to say ""I don't think that this class of person should exist, for the protection of everyone.""? Humanity is not exactly struggling-- there are 7 Billion of us.

Okay, so really quick, lets talk about Buck v. Bell. [Buck v. Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) was the SCOTUS case in the 1927 where the forced sterilization of the ""feeble minded"" was permitted. This case has never been overturned. In the case, Carrie Buck was ordered sterilized for being ""mentally feeble."" As it turns out, Nuck had actually been institutionalized to cover up her rape at the hands of her adopted mother's nephew. She was never mentally feeble at all. SCOTUS still upheld her sterilization for the ""health and safety of the nation."" One by one, all the states repealed their laws that allowed for such sterilizations. Nazis, however, cited Buck v. Bell in their defense at the Nuremberg Trials.

If you allow any eugenics, you are creating thousands of Carrie Bucks at a minimum. Many, many people will be wrongfully harmed, not just because eugenics is wrong, but because governments are *really* bad at getting it right.

ihoktz3,StoicInTheCentre,"Australian here. As a disclaimer, I 100% sympathise with you - making animals suffer to try and un-fuck a human mistake is really rough, and I wish there was another way. That being said, let's go point-by-point:

&gt;...read that neuter/spaying cats then releasing them isn’t a good option because they can still kill birds after they’re released. So, why don’t they simply not release the cats?  
&gt;  
&gt;My first idea: they build huge enclosures (almost like a zoo) where the cats can live the rest of their days out in peace (while not hurting birds). The Australian government might even make some money doing this. Because I would assuming having a cat zoo would bring in a lot of visitors. Additionally, they could make it where people can adopt the cats. Imagine all the international tourists who go to the cat zoo while visiting Australia, fall in love with a cat, and take it back home.

You've already acknowledged that the idea is a stretch, but I want to impress upon you just how much of a stretch it is to keep all the animals alive, fed and accommodated somewhere while you wait for them to die a natural death. According to the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, The Environment and Water (DCCEEW), there are 2.1 - 6.3 **million** feral cats in Australia. Just think about that number for a moment. How would you go about accommodating them? Cats are solitary predators - dominant male cats may have territories of up to 8 km2, while the territories of females are smaller and may even be halved while kittens are being reared. If you're goal is to be humane, I assume you wouldn't want to pack them in like factory-farmed animals, so where do we even get the space? Much less the food, water, veterinary staff, support staff, etc.? I think we can agree that this is not a feasible option, so let's move to:

&gt;Potentially they could send the cats to other countries, or declaw the cats, or build enclosures to protect the birds?

Again, according to DCCEEW:

&gt;Feral cats threaten the survival of over 100 native species in Australia. They have caused the extinction of some ground-dwelling birds and small to medium-sized mammals. They are a major cause of decline for many land-based endangered animals such as the bilby, bandicoot, bettong and numbat.

And this article from the Smithsonian [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/australias-cats-kill-two-billion-animals-annually-180977235/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/australias-cats-kill-two-billion-animals-annually-180977235/) leads with:

&gt;Australia’s Cats Kill Two Billion Animals Annually

There is no stopping these creatures. They are the perfect predator in Australia, with it's lack of large predatory mammals and preponderance of endangered, small marsupials, it's almost like they're purpose-built to cause mass-extinctions.

ihoy39f,DouglerK,"Futanari is arguably fetishization. Hentai is full of fetishes.

I'm not sure what crowds you roll with where talking about other hentai fetishes don't offend people but ""futa"" or futanari does. 

Basically the times where it is not going to be offensive is actually quite exceptional. You said yourself you wouldn't say it in the company of those who find it offensive. That would be 99% of the time with everyone except certain individuals. Hentai in general is going to be an offensive topic most of the time. 

Even with just the word in particular. The fact that you recognize that you need to be discretionary with the use of the word means that it's offensive enough to warrant that discretion. A word being offensive really comes down to how many people actually find it offensive and how often it's use actually affects them. The latter might not be so relevant here but for the former even you acknowledge there are enough people who do find it offensive to warrant discrection. 

So if you're talking to other people about your fetishes who also don't find futa to be offensive then go ahead and say it. You couldn't be stopped. Nobody would even know. Any offensive word can be said i secret or away from the people it offends.

 It is also specifically a porn term. If you aren't having a porn conversation then it would be quote offensive to describe someone or something in porn terms.

Also just a second much less complicated thought. Futa is short for Futanari. Tranny is short for transexual. Tranny is pretty offensive. Transsexual is not so offensive. You think something similar is going on with ""Futa"" and the specific relationship to fetish material being the worst representation of it? Futanari is ""dual form"" and androgyny and hermaphroditism. ""Futa"" is a porn fetish. 

Similarly hermaphrodite is a politically incorrect word to use sometimes. Hermaphrositism is a specific disorder. In (especially hentai) porn the subjects are made up. Artists can draw them as whatever their fetish wants them to be. They are some kind of fetishized ideal. They aren't real people. In reality people are much more complicated.

ihs5t6d,breckenridgeback,"Okay I thought this was a trans thread but I guess this is a depression thread. Cool, I can roll with that.

&gt; One of the sexual disorders they told me about was just that: that they are asexual [in the general sense].

Being asexual is not a disorder. Some people just don't feel much or any sexual attraction.

Now, it's true that hormone treatments can temporarily kill libido - I don't think I had a sexual thought for something like six months when I had first started hormones - but that's distinct from being asexual.

The fact that hormones kill libido doesn't mean your friend *isn't* ace, though.

&gt; They've always been seen I hate to say now in hindsight as a 'fussy eater', and have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder that involves limitations of varieties of foods.

This sounds, to me, like something vaguely autism-spectrum-y. It's pretty common for people on the spectrum to be picky, and trans people are on the spectrum at rates far higher than the general public (exactly why that is isn't known).

&gt; When one isn't brought up well as a child it might manifest in between childhood and young-adulthood as a thing that they utilise as a means of compensation. One of the points of my above asexual digression is that it's also is another 'label' that's unorthodox and interesting, which is the common denominator between all the mental complications this person suffers from, whether professionally diagnosed or self-accounted. My point isn't that kids and young adults are making it all up for attention (KEY THING HERE: THEY ARE NOT), but rather that these titles that they use and ultimately become diagnosed with are things that their id has subconsciously driven them into not wanting to abandon for fear of being rejected for being plain.

This is kind of unfalsifiable, but it is also a very common (wrong) response to people dealing with various forms of mental illness.

&gt; Otherwise, realistically, what are the odds of a person (the same as who I've been writing about) being diagnosed with several disorders

High. Those conditions are heavily correlated with one another, and being trans screws a whole lot of stuff up until one can access transition care (which dramatically reduces rates of e.g. depression).

&gt; The therapists, instead of legitemately ridding them of it, only advance it.

Treating a condition isn't ""advancing"" it.

&gt; This person has had (on their account) long-term depression easily caused by nutritional deficiencies (such as magnesium), and it, now being clinically diagnosed, lately has worsened because of unnatural hormone levels from excess oestrogen

Estrogen actually has weak antidepressant effects, so if anything that should be helping (somewhat aside from transitioning helping too).

&gt; and on top of that will be given antidepressants which makes psychiatric disorders even worse

...no. Antidepressants don't ""make psychiatric disorders even worse"". Speaking as someone who is alive today and far more mentally healthy because of being on a working one even briefly, I can say that with some personal conviction. But also like...what, you think there's a whole field that exists purely to give you a drug that actively hurts you? Do you think every therapist in the world is some mad scientist cackling in their evil lair or something?

&gt; and absolutely no benefit has been given to the client here except the superficial satisfaction that they have a slightly altered appearance and voice.

Transition was far more than ""superficial satisfaction"" for me, and it is for most trans people. I am way, way, WAY happier and healthier post-transition and (for unrelated reasons) post-care-for-depression than I have been at any other point in my life, to the point that it feels like every second before those things was just a waste when I could've been feeling better all along.

&gt; A therapist's job shouldn't be to prescribe pills to people with depression, but rather find the root cause of it (whether internal or external), and deal with it on that basis alone.

Well, one, depression is somewhat self-sustaining even without whatever triggered it, and for two, the root cause is somewhat biological, and antidepressants are how you address that root cause.

&gt; It should also be their job to rather promote habits and practices that contribute to the ridding of the illness, not dosages of artificial numbness of it.

They do. That's...kind of the whole point of therapy, and psychiatric meds and therapy are known to work better together than either of them does alone. Meds give you some strength to fight back, and therapy shows you where to best direct that energy.

ihv3pl7,McKoijion,"My heart is human. Historically, people thought that's where love came from. But it turns out love exists only in the brain. The heart is just an tool that pumps blood to my brain. If I get a heart transplant, my old heart would be dead. But I would continue to be alive. But if my heart is used in a heart transplant for someone else, I would be dead even though my heart would beat on in someone else.

This ultimately means that our consciousness/personality/soul exists in the brain, not in the rest of our body. All your other cells are human life, but they aren't important. We can grow heart cells in a lab and they start beating right in the lab dish. But we can't grow a human personality/consciousness/soul. It's also not all parts of the brain, just the upper parts. The lower parts just manage unconscious, mechanical actions like breathing when we aren't paying attention to it.

In this way, a fetus is human. Everyone, including 99% of the National Academy of Sciences, agrees life starts at conception. The question is whether that consciousness/personality/soul also starts at conception. Evangelical Christian people people say all living cells are special. Scientists typically say that you need to form the bare minimum parts of a brain that can house a consciousness/personality/soul before you can even begin to have one. Reaching that point takes about 6 months. Before that point a fetus can't exist outside the mother. But coincidentally (or not coincidentally) after that point, the fetus can live outside the mother.

When people say ""human"" in this context they mean a person with a consciousness/personality/soul. They don't typically mean replaceable organic human tissue like hair, fingernails, skin cells, bones, livers, etc. In this way, killing a fetus after it forms a consciousness/soul/personality is murder. Aborting a fetus before it forms the bare minimum brain parts to house a consciousness/soul/personality is the moral equivalent of a haircut.",False

ihvbwyx,McKoijion,"Human brains don’t fully develop until 25 or even 30 years old. Even after 6 months, it probably takes a long time to develop a consciousness/personality/soul. But I want to avoid even the bare minimum risk of hurting a human with a personality/consciousness/soul. That means if they have the bare minimum structures needed to have thoughts, I wouldn’t abort. That takes about 5-6 months. There’s a few weeks of variation because sperm can live in a woman for a while, nuances of the ovulation cycle, tiny differences in rates of development between fetuses, etc.

This doesn’t apply to all fetuses. Many have major developmental defects that prevent them from ever developing upper brain structures. They can be aborted well after 6 months. If they aren’t, they’ll be stillborn. Furthermore, sometimes fetuses develop brains, but it ends up being a life of mother vs. life of baby and mother trade off. I’d consider this to be a horrible circumstance that’s similar to a child dying in a car crash. It’s just a sad part of life. Lastly, it can be either a mother or baby trade off. Then it’s the trolley problem. 

The great thing about this is that the early abortion technique basically stops the fetus from developing, thereby killing it. There is a 0 percent chance a 4 month fetus has the upper brain structures to house a consciousness/personality/soul. The later 5-6 month method is to just induce labor and give birth to the fetus. If it survives, it reached the point of developing upper brain structures and can be put up for adoption. If it is stillborn, it never developed the upper brain structures in the first place.

Ultimately, modern abortion techniques mean there’s a 0 percent chance of ever harming a fetus with the bare minimum brain structures to house a consciousness/personality/soul. Even a 0.00001% chance would be unacceptable. But it’s 0% unless you think all human cells are sacred, not just the ones capable of consciousness.

However, there is a legitimate debate on when the embryo or fetus becomes sufficiently human to be protected as an individual.   Of course, the whole topic of abortion is also intertwined with a woman's autonomy over her body.   You seem to want to say that how people feel about the last point (the legal rights of a woman's autonomy over her body) is determining their position on the first point (when is a fetus a protected individual).

California quail how ever do not migrate. Well they do but not nearly as much and are generally localized.

One of the most famous pieces of humorous satire, [A Modest Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal), was a genuine and heartfelt response to the brutality that the British had enacted on the Irish population. It is a horrified response to a series of policies that were effectively genocidal in scope, and the author sarcastically responds to them by saying ""well, why not just eat them while we're at it?"" This was over the line for many members of his audience - which was, literally, exactly the point of the essay. The entire reason he wrote the essay was to shock the British public out of their complacency with regards to the horrible things happening to the Irish. They didn't care about the Irish being brutalized or starved, but they DID care about the idea of them being cannibalized.

The essay was written because of ""earnestly held political beliefs"" about a topic that is grotesque...because that was the point.

ihw2kly,badass_panda,"Just to clarify, you're talking about surgery specifically. I'm not sure how controversial that is on its own.

However, here's where you jump off a big old cliff:

&gt;I also don’t think that minors should be allowed to take puberty blockers, as the side effects can be permanent vision loss and IIH. IIH also has increased risks for other problems, like depression, suicide

This is an absurd position for you to take. I'm not trying to be a jerk, just pointing out that you've set up a glaringly false dichotomy. You're saying that children shouldn't be allowed to make choices that irrevocably affect their bodies -- fine, but how on earth is *going through puberty* ***not*** *an irreversible change on their body?*

Let's lay it out:

1. **Among adults who self-identify as transgender, gender affirming therapies are highly effective and achieve a substantial reduction in rates of suicide and self-harm.** This is non-controversial; it's the accepted medical position. Unless you believe that the American Medical Association, Psychological Association, Pediatric Association, National Institute of Health and World Health Organization have all failed to review the literature and make an informed, patient-oriented choice, I shouldn't have to prove this to you.
2. **These therapies correct, largely, for the effects of puberty.** While bottom surgery specifically does not, all the other surgical interventions are responses to puberty.

The choice isn't between, ""Do nothing and nothing bad happens,"" vs ""Do something and possibly get bad headaches.""

The choice is between, ""Do nothing and go through puberty, greatly increasing dysmorphia and suicidal ideation,"" and ""Do something, defer puberty, and very slightly increase the chance of negative side effects.""

Why *on earth* should the effect that we *know* is certain, and that is quite *likely* to be negative, be viewed as ""safe"" (over the experiences of trans people themselves, and the recommendations of medical personnel) while the slightest possibility of a side effect from a treatment that prevents it is ""too dangerous""?

ihwibss,grimorg80,"Alright, so if you believe it's the result of human choice, then you should be more inquisitive and inform yourself on the actual mechanics of modern economies. 

To make it short: none of the monetary scarcity the governments with a fiat currency (like the US and the UK) is real. Money is not scarce, and in fact, central banks must pay whatever their respective governments instruct them to. Money must be generated before it can be regained with tax. No money spent, no taxation. Inflation is about maintaing a balance between money taxed back and savings. When money is in circulation, it multiplies the tax coming back. When it goes towards only 1% of the population, it dies. 

Inflation is run by never before seen profits for shareholders. The wealth generated is extracted from the working class, if not injected by the state. 

That's simple modern economics since abandoned the gold standard. Nothing more, nothing less. 

People at the top, the richest, who make money through the financial markets, count on people not realising that money is indeed not scarce. Banks wouldn't be able to ask for a higher interest, and eventually own half a country via asset seizing.

It's not conspiratorial. It's the sad reality.

This form of capitalism started generating wealth in a cycle that was supposed to last forever. People at the top are making more money than ever. Way above inflation. 

It's only human to imagine a response from the working class, which is currently asked to take the brunt of the supply issues.

Game Pass makes this point moot, both on PC and consoles. I haven't bought a game in 2 years.

&gt; PCs allow you to cusomize your gaming experience to a much larger degree. For some reason console games usually have a severly limited settings menu compared to PC, not only relating to graphics settings but also chaging the button mapping.

Cheap PCs do not do well with heavy games that need a lot of resources. They just don't. I play the Sims on a pretty high spec PC that has a lot of custom content and mods. A low end laptop will set itself on fire and scream as it burns if I tried to play on it. Low end PCs, as the suggestion says, are low end. They are not intended to take the strain of heavy gaming and thus, if you want to PC game, you have to pay the price. My PC was $1500. I am not a builder, I cannot build my own so I had to pay the price to have someone else do it for me. I can get a PS5 with higher specs than my current PC that does a lot of extra things for 1/2 the price and still have enough to buy a decent enough tv to not worry about it. 

You underestimate the value of plug and play devices, too. A console is accessible for a large number of younger people who lack the knowledge or the patience to build a good quality PC with all the bells and whistles needed. It's easy for parents to buy, too - a child could send almost any parent for a PS5 as a birthday gift and they'd come back with a PS5. Give them a shopping list for a high spec PC or the parts and they'd be baffled. 

It's also more accessible in general. Grandma doesn't type, doesn't know how to use the computer that is barely powerful enough to run amazon, and doesn't have internet. What she does have is a TV and the willingness to let her three grandkids come over for the weekend and hook up their console to her tv and let them game for hours. Grandma can even join in - there's less buttons, the joy sticks are intutitve and the device is easy to hold for her arthritic hands. 

&gt; Console has extremly limited modding abilities. Few games on console have mods at all, and if they have the selection is limited compared to PC.

Not everybody wants mods. Some people are purists. 

&gt; There is no hardware advantage in competative multiplayer games. There still is. Different people will use different versions of the console, have different screens with different input lag, have different internet speed. Consoles do even the playing field by a small amount, but we are splitting hairs at this point.

ihwxbp6,abu_hajaaar,"Pitbulls were originally bred for that purpose but that was over 100 years ago at least and have since been bred for house pets and looks for the most part. The pit bulls originally bred are not the same house pets you see today. That being said, I’m not one of those people that say it’s all in the way you raise them and pitbulls aren’t any more dangerous than another large breed. Different breeds have different capabilities and different temperaments and most people who have had dogs their whole lives would agree with that. There’s also a such thing as a bad dog just like there are bad humans but that is rare. There are numerous breeds that don’t make good house pets and are much more aggressive and dangerous than the common pitbull that are not recognized for it because they aren’t common like the pit bull. Many working breeds have demand as house pets so you have dogs like the Belgian Malinois, Caucasian ovcharka, high content wolf dogs, the dogo Argentino being sold as pets which is often a disaster. But others like German shepherds and huskies and pit bulls have been bred as pets for long enough that they have significantly distinguished themselves from the working lineage. 

That being said, I’ve grown up around dogs my entire life including dozens of pitbulls with family and friends and none of them were aggressive. I’ve been taking my dogs to the dog park for 2 decades where there are half a dozen pitbulls and any given time that I’ve never met and none of them have ever been aggressive. But I grew up in a higher income area. I think a lot of the statistics for violence among dogs as well as people are a result of socioeconomic conditions. Also, most pitbulls are pit mixes at best and any time something remotely looks like it has pit in it following an incident is labeled pit bull which skews the statistics a bit and makes it more complicated.

ihxypec,stubble3417,"Consider the the CEO of turbotax. Like all tax preparation companies, turbotax spends tens of millions of dollars to lobby the US government to protect their extremely lucrative tax preparation business. Among other things, this includes ensuring that the tax code stays highly complicated. If taxes and exemptions were simplified, or even reduced to a simple bill the government sends you based on the information they already have, turbotax would instantly become irrelevant. 

Now, who is contributing more to society: the CEO of intuit (turbotax's corporate name) who makes about $25,000,000 a year? Or an artist who is commissioned to create pieces for public buildings, spaces, and parks? 

Here's the unfortunate truth: most jobs are unnecessary. Maybe not as starkly unnecessary as turbotax.

ihy8d4o,poprostumort,"&gt;That being said lets start with money. According to \[this article\](link expunged due to reddit spam filter) a PC with equivalent performance to a PS5 costs 77$ more (I think in practice the difference is a bit larger). But xbox and PS have a fee to play online of 60$ per year.

Let's do the math. MSRP of PS5 is $500. Let's be generous and say that you had to overpay to get your hands on it and pais $600. Online play is $60/year and console generation is 4-6 years long. So maths puts as at total cost over generation at $960. Let's round it up to $1000.

Currently a good $1000 gaming pc would have following specs:  
\- Ryzen 5 5600  
\- 500GB M2 SATA drive  
\- RTX3060  
\- 16GB of RAM

It's power would be comparable to PS5 so it's a tie if we consider current state of things. But when we look from point of view that:

&gt;You will also have to buy a new console every few years if you want to keep up with new game releases, while a PC will be compatible with all games released in the foreseeable future and most games released in the past

We also need to consider how this PC would fare throughout 6 years compared to console. And the answer is unfortunately: poorly.

Console has an advantage that games are directly written to that hardware. More time console has on the market means more experience for devs. And they tend to learn how to push more from the same console. This is not the case for PC. Ports usually don't offer the same level of juicing out components so through time, games will tend to have slowly increasing requirements. For a PC in $1000 price point, it will mean that it will inevitably suffer in performance when comparing the same graphics quality, so you will need to either live with dropping graphics to lower settings or fork out some money for upgrade.

So we have slight win on console side.

&gt;Of course newer games demand more and more performance so in practice you will have to upgrader your PC eventually

So let's consider how it would fare if we would assume upgrade in console budget when new gen hits. Let's look at how $1000 PC from PS4 launch looked:

\- Intel Core i5-4670K  
\- 250GB 3.5 SATA SSD  
\- 8GB of RAM (DDR3 1600 Mhz)  
\- GTX 760 OC

And what can we re-use, what we need to buy. We can stay with this CPU so wea re set with CPU and MoBo. We are definitely need to up RAM to be safe so we need second DDR3 stick, same as currently there  ($50), larger SSD preferably M2 if we have that slot ($60) and new graphics card with power equivalent to 3060 (around $500). so cost of upgrade is already crossing the $600 line and this upgrade will not make this gaming PC live another 6 years, 2-3 at best. After that time you will need to upgrade CPU RAM and MoBo and reuse rest. This would rather eat remaining $400, considering prices of parts.

So it's a tie on money side. But when you compare switching consoles and juggling PC parts to arrange budget well - it's a slight win for console.

&gt;PC has way more games. To such an extent that certain genres of games (are very rare or) dont exist at all on console (rts, moba, indie, gamejam, ect.).

Impossible to compare so it would need to be ignored as it comes down to preferrence. PC has a great backlog of older games, while current consoles have backwards compatibility.

&gt; I would also argue that games are generally cheaper on PC since multiple stores are competing with sales, and because of p\*racy.

And there is no second-hand market which exists on consoles. So it is not really an advantage.

So all in all it would seem that console would win albeit only slightly, right? Well, if you have $1000 budget then yes, it would win only slightly. But if you have $500 budget, it would be a huge win for console as you will still get the same experience with this upfront cost, while it would dramatically slash your PC experience.

And I have been comparing PC to PS5, which is less cost-effective solution. Xbox One X with Gamepass bought on discount would be a steal compared to any $500 PC. I also given PC a headstart by not counting prices of peripherials or system.

And if you have lower budget? sub $400 PC is a piece of crap for gaming. Sub $400 console is a last gen PS4 or current gen Switch/Xbox One S. There is no comparison between gaming experience on those and sub $400 pc.

When the same people advocate for assisted suicide they are also referring to that person's potential for pleasure and pain, and not their current state.

Since the fetus isn't a human yet, we can't apply the same morals we apply to humans, but we can apply the same morals we apply to humans to the future version of the fetus after it's born. If you believe that we should prevent suffering when possible, and there's a high chance that the potential human would suffer immensely after they're born, you might believe that it would be ""better"" for this future person if they were aborted now. This isn't the only conclusion you could reach of course, but it does make sense depending on how you view life and suffering. Notice that with this logic I'm still not applying any morals to the fetus, only to its potential.

For example, let's say you're put in a room with a button in front of you. If you press the button, it will cause an event that will have real consequences on someone else's life for the rest of their life. It could cause them either pain, pleasure, or change nothing, but the chance of it causing pain is a lot higher than the other scenarios, say like 95%. If you have reason to believe this is true, I think most people wouldn't take that chance and would rather not press the button. Does it really matter if the person who would be affected by it has been born yet or not? I think not, because we are talking about their potential for pleasure and pain, and not their current state of it.",False

ii1dqlg,draculabakula,"&gt;Firstly the entire fascination with “rings” started as a way to discredit the greatness of LeBron James. Nobody would ever say Tony Parker is better than Chris Paul, but he has 4 championships.

 I will give you some history.

[https://www.bostoncelticshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volumes\_Photos12\_Other\_History\_6-Russell\_Russell\_Bill\_Russell74072185-scaled.jpg](https://www.bostoncelticshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volumes_Photos12_Other_History_6-Russell_Russell_Bill_Russell74072185-scaled.jpg)

Before Lebron ever played basketball there was a debate whether Michael Jordan was the best basketball player ever or not. Before Jordan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar or Wilt Chamberlain were most commonly considered the GOAT. The picture I linked was a reminder that there was a player that had way more rings than any of them."" 

So to say that referencing ""rings"" was started to discredit Lebron is nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kobe’s “5 rings” are overrated. He played with a top 10 all time NBA talent Center, in his prime that averaged 35/15 in the finals. He even got a ring averaging 15ppg like a roll player. Kobe is an all time great guard but his Finals performances are looking funny under a microscope 🔬

Overrated how? Yo**u never gave an example of what you are responding to in terms of hw people rate him.** I don't think anybody would ever say he is the best SG of all time but nobody should say he is not it the top 3.

Keep in mind Kobe won two titles without Shaq. Kobe stans like to discredit Pau Gasol but Kobe was still very obviously the leader of that team and the main reason why they won. In 2009 Kobe average 32 pts, 5 rebs, 7 assists in the finals. 

**During the 3 peat, the centers Shaq matched up against in the finals were a washed Rik Smiths in his last season, a 34 year old  Dikembe Mutombo, and Todd Maculloh**. Only Dikembe is a respectable match up and Shaq didn't play as well in that series. He was still great but hopefully you get my point. He wasn't playing peak players. The year before, when the Spurs were healthy, Shaq and Kobe got swept.

**Also, you are doing the same thing to Kobe as what people do to Lebron.** Keep in mind that when Lebron went to the Heat, it wasn't enough for him to be on the same team as a top 5 all time SG and a top 3 at the time PF. They needed to bring in a bunch of more talent to win. When the Cavs beat the Warriors, it is considered the worst officiated series of all time, and when Lebron won in 2020 with the Lakers he greatly benefitted from the shortened season and the bubble. 

**My point here is not to discredit Lebron or Shaq but to point out that you can make a case against any superstar.**",False

They literally insert new tissue into joints in a way where players basically have new knees and joints. I guarantee players over 30 all get this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are also trenbalone that only last in your body for 4 hours. The maximum it shows for any test currently is 21 hours. It existed back in the day but guaranteed 95% of the league has done it at some point.

To me, the NFL helping you is different from scientific advancements that just happened to exist during your career.

ii344kl,draculabakula,"Yeah but there are always those things. In 1978 (the year before Montana was drafted) they made it so the defender couldn't touch the receiver after the first 5 yards. The league average instantly went from 300 yards a game to 400 and rushing immediately started becoming less common. 

In Jordan era they losened restrictions on traveling.

Before he played,  Wilt always dunked the ball for free throws since high school and they banned it when he entered the league lesson him without knowing how to shoot free throws. They also widened the land because of him.

ii551ed,draculabakula,"My point was that making it so CBs couldn't touch the receiver after 5 years made it much easier for receivers and QBs. Before the rule change every defender was allowed to ""chuck"" (essentially run intoa hard as they wanted without knocking the recurve over) exactly once whilr the receiver was running their route. This meant that a safety could come up with the ball was in the air and hip check the receiver.

You can see how much easier it became to complete passes down field after the changed that. 

In the late 1990s, they made it illegal for players to hand check in the NBA. This made it much easier for small weaker players to score. In the early 2000s they made it illegal for the defender to crowd the shooters landing zone. In the early 2010s they defined the gather step which essentially gave the ball handler an extra step without having to dribble. All these things directly allowed players like Steph Curry and James Harden to be successful. It's safe to say that without those rule changes Steph Curry wouldn't be half the player he is. He would get pushed off balance before his shot, then he would get called for a travel for his double step back three, then he would get injured when he landed on the defender who just walked right into his landing zone.

The dead ball era ended in 1920 when the MLB made it illegal to lick, spit on out Scuff the ball and they made it so the game used multiple balls per game instead of just one. In 1919, the year before the rule change, Babe Ruth broke the record with 29 home runs. The first year of the rule change he hit 54. The year after he hit 59. At the end of the 1930 season,  10 players hit over 35 home runs in a single season.

There's a million things like this.  In 2003 (Lebrons first season) the league changed the playoffs so the first round is now best of 7 instead of best of 5. Before 1983 the first round was best of 3. Some how Lebron owns every playoff total stat category even  though there is are players like Jordan, Kareem, Duncan, and Russell who all had more titles than him. They also changed the way the seeding worked early which made series go longer by having better teams play earlier in the playoffs in Lebrons career and they went from 4 divisions to 6. The last two are obviously minor advantages compared to being guaranteed a minimum of one extra game per year",False

&gt;STDs can, quite literally, ruin a person's life

What STD ruins a person's life? Syphilis and Chlamydia are minor and treated with a pill that clears them up in a week and then they're forever out of your body.

Herpes has no cure and is life-long, but it's also not a health risk. It's so harmless that doctors don't even check for it when you get a full STD testing done. They recommend against testing for it because the social stigma far outweighs getting three pimples on your genitals for 1 week, every other year. In fact, there's a good chance you already have herpes. 11% of Americans have genital herpes, and about 50% have oral herpes. Herpes is also treatable if you're supremely unlucky and have frequent outbreaks, via a pill.

Even for HIV, only 0.3% of Americans have it, and those that do live lives on par with those who don't via treatment (usually a single pill a day).

It's sad because by far the worst aspects of STDs aren't the diseases themselves, but the social stigma around them. This stigma is often fueled by simple ignorance of STDs.

&gt;i would worry constantly

I've talked about how the risks aren't as risky as I think you're painting them, but we also need to look at the cost of your viewpoint. Denying yourself sex is massive. Abstinence just isn't realistic, does more harm than good, and there's no good reason for it. Sex is amazing and we shouldn't deprive ourselves of something that's safe and natural. Especially since we can do it while taking precautions. Sex releases oxytocin, which builds greater bonds between people. It's extremely difficult to only have a pure friends with benefits. Those sound great, but rarely work out. People can't help but get attached and catch feelings. That's the power of sex, and why should we be denied it until we're in our what, 40s? Most people don't have their career down until mid-life. That seems crazy to me. You don't think so?

You're right there is a risk, but it's absolutely tiny relative to the rewards. We take so many more risks every day. Risking crossing the street. Making an expensive purchase when you could lose your apartment or home to a fire the next day. Choose a college major that turns out to not be your passion. Eat some food that could make you ill via food poisoning or an allergic reaction.

Further, imagine that the lesser evil party in this case does want some improvements, but they're simply not enough. 


Now imagine there are third parties that do want enough change. In this case, voting for these third parties is actually useful en masse, even though they won't win and will likely be spoilers for the lesser evil.


What can happen is that lesser evil party loses the election, and then realises the demand for third party participation in the democracy. Importantly tho, they also realise that almost all of these third parties are more likely to work with them than with the other major party. So for next election, they make a promise; if we win, we will appoint an election committee that will look into how we can make a fairer democracy that ensures people have local reps, but also allows minority party engagement in democracy.

Having multiple wives is expensive, a man has to earn enough to take care of all his wives as well as all the kids he will have from those wives. Thus, in all the societies, it were the rich and powerful who practiced polygamy, because they were the only ones who could afford to.

iiam6q1,zRexxz,"The only reason the third option ""has no chance"" is **because** we choose not to vote for it.

Like, this is the problem with the argument here. People say you shouldn't vote third party because it 'doesn't have a chance' but the only reason it doesn't have a chance is directly **because** of the presumption that they aren't going to win and so no one votes for them.

It's a self-fulfilled prophecy is what I'm saying. It's the very mindset that these parties don't have a chance that **causes** them to not have a chance. We create the lack of chance by choosing not to vote for them in the first place.

If we didn't have that pre-existing belief against third parties and weighed them equally in our options compared to other parties, it's very well possible that they could have much greater of a chance than they currently end up having. But the fact that we assume they have no chance causes their chances to be lesser than if we assume they did have a chance.

So basically, if your argument is: ""third parties don't have a chance"". That's why the solution is **vote for the third party.** Because that's how we increase the chance of the third party winning. I too, believe that third parties ""don't have a chance"", so thus I choose to vote for the third party to increase their chance (albeit slightly, by one vote).

Obviously me voting for the third party alone isn't going to increase its chances far enough to change the tide of the entire election. But I don't blame that on the third party being an ""unviable option"". I blame that on the fact that I'm one of the only few people who seem smart enough to realize the whole ""self-fulfilled prophecy"" that everyone else is getting duped into. If everyone else realized it too, and recognized that it's only our voting patterns and beliefs against third parties that's determining whether the third party has a chance of winning or not, then we could all come to the conclusion ""Hey, technically *any* option has a chance of winning as long as we all vote for it"" and then we all do the smart move which is to vote for the third party and then it actually **does** have a chance of winning. That's really the crux of the problem here.

In short, the ""third parties aren't going to win so why vote for them"" mindset is a logical paradox. We create the problem that we end up criticizing third parties for. We shape the outcomes, we shape the very notion of ""which parties have a chance and which don't"" with our vote.

My mindset when voting is, I'm going to avoid falling in the trap that everyone else falls into. Maybe if enough people catch on, it can spark some kind of gradual shift in how we think about voting. But if you guys want to doom shit by saying ""the third party isn't going to work"", so there's a split vote between the third party and the ""lesser of two evils"" and thus the ""greatest evil"" ends up winning, that's on you guys. It's everyone else's collective stupidity that led to the ""greatest evil"" winning. I'm not going to walk on eggshells by changing my voting patterns to compensate for the fact that everyone else is an idiot when it comes to voting. Imo, it's up to the population to realize this entire thing is simply a consequence of how they choose to vote and their bias against the third party in the first place.

If people really want the ""greatest evil"" not to win the election - the ""lesser two of evils"" logic can apply the opposite way. If people really want to prevent the ""greatest evil"" from winning, they can join me in voting for the third party. I don't get why the sole solution is me changing **my** voting patterns to compensate for everyone else’s stupidity. Everyone else can change their voting patterns to support the third party just as I can change my voting pattern to support the lesser of 2 evils. It's not the ""third party"" that's the problem - it's everyone else's stupidity in thinking that the ""lesser of 2 evils is the only way"" that's the problem.",False

2, Wait, so you don't believe the cheese or milk literally exists? So this yellow block I'm holding in my hand right now, what do you call it?

1, Did I? What about soy milk? Or coconut milk? Are they the secretions of cows?

2, Well, no.

1, See? Milk doesn't exist!!!

You see, these two people are talking about the same thing. One just refuses to use the words that society uses because of some personal idea that words should somehow be pure. You are doing exactly the same thing.

&gt;I think society has such rigid standards on what constitutes man or woman / masculinity or femininity, that when someone falls outside of what society defines as being masculine or feminine they may feel compelled to identify as the opposite sex.

Yes, gender is a social construct. 

&gt; This usually leads to the victim developing resentment towards the physical features that are unique to their sex. It makes sense because if they did not have those physical features (in other words, if they were not a member of that sex) then they would be able to express themselves without backlash from society.

And yes, this disconnect between what one ought to identify as and what one does identify as is causing them undue stress and suffering. Nobody is disputing that. The only thing what you and the society disagree at is the label by which you should call these people.

&gt; If people were accepted for who they are they wouldn't feel the need to undergo surgeries and hormone treatments.

Perhaps. Let's grant all of this as true. Let's assume there is no pure bodily dysmorphia involved in regards to trans people. And let's assume the problem is entirely psychological. A combination of social conditioning, trauma, ostracization, etc...

Assuming all of this is true. Does it change anything? Because these people still experience an undue stress and suffering and no other treatment seem to be effective. If the only viable alternative to hormonal therapy, surgery and whatnot is changing the ENTIRETY OF SOCIETY. How could you treat those people, if you prohibit trans care right now? Because even if we assume that we can change the entirety of society, it won't happen overnight. And until then what other option for transgender people is there?

Because like it or not. The current medical intervention is the only effective treatment we have. And yes it relies on changing the people's bodies in a radical way to conform to the narrow categories our society created over it's millennia of existence. And yes, perhaps an androgynous society is both possible and better. But we are not there, are we? And people still experience a very real problem, right?

iiazt81,budlejari,"It comes across as it's more important to be accurate than to listen to someone else's feelings and validate their emotion at hand.

And that's rude. 

If we are in a science setting, and being accurate about the number of men who did x versus not, it would be valid to correct your coworker to say ""not all men did x"" because that might impact the research. 

But if someone is upset and unhappy about something that has happened to them and they are venting by saying ""all men suck!"" listening to them and seeking to understand what they mean when you tell them ""not all men?"" or are you prizing being technically right over their actual need when it makes no difference to you in that moment? 

A lot of this is about *nuance* and *timing*. 'Valid argument' implies that there's a back and forth. Butting into someone else's venting to impose a technicality on them... not so much. Being right is a good thing. Being right *all the time* by forcing yourself into a conversation that didn't need you to invade to correct one small statement when it's highkey unnecessary is borish and rude. 

Edit, since lots of people are taking this to the nth degree because I didn't add any limits on it, which I should have done. That doesn't mean that you should let this stand *forever*. It doesn't mean you shouldn't point out the sexism, or racism, or whatever. But it means you should *pick your time* and consider the situation *before* you make this into a ""you said a bad thing and I'm disappointed in you"" moment. You should consider how close you are with the situation, the person, and whether your contribution will help or whether it will come across as pedantic and dismissive of the actual issue in an effort to be more right than the other person. 

If someone is mad that they just got broken up with and they're losing their home and they're angry and crying about it to their friends and you're just a classmate with no emotional involvement - not a good time to turn this into a teachable moment and you're not benefitting anybody involved here. Save it for later, when the other side is calmer and more open to listening. If they're just complaining about a server who forgot a dish, that's a good time to bring it up and point it out in the moment.  

This is where the *nuance* and the *timing* part comes in. Pick your moment, the way you convey this, and the actual take away you want them to have.

Edit 2: I turned off all inbox replies because wow, there's a lot here. But, long story short, I've made some edits since people don't seem to understand what this means.  

This post *explicitly* responds to the 'not all men' issue, and the fact that OP states it's a *valid and appropriate* response to other people venting about a patriarchy issue involving men. It *explicitly* responds to the argument that saying not all men is more important because being right the highest priority. It challenges the OP by suggesting that it's more important to listen to the issue, the speakers, and the context of the discussion before formulating a response that also challenges the sexism inherent in such statements like ""all men are trash."" 

It is *directly* about producing a conversation that will change people's minds and decrease the likelihood of repeating the behavior rather than making people feel invalidated and like the only thing you care about is being technically right or defending men in a situation where men are the perpetrators of violence, harm, or negative things at the expense of the women involved. 

It is not a defense of bigotry, it is not a 'women can be sexist and men can't' issue (women can be sexist about men) and it's not a 'women can say whatever'. It's not that women must never be challenged quickly and forthrightly about sexism. 

This is where the nuance comes in.

It's about understanding that being right isn't the most important thing in a conversation *in this specific set of circumstances* and if you want to actually challenge sexism, you can't hyperfocus in on a tiny aspect at the expense of everything else in the conversation. 

Intention does a lot of lifting here, *in this specific set of circumstances* on both sides, and if the goal is to challenge sexism, you gotta be willing to open the door and have a conversation, even if you don't like what they say, not roll in with a tired, memed out old line and then get mad when people don't respond to it well.",False

This is not correct.

First of all, the commandments are never actually numbered. Moses says ""Here are the Ten Commandments"" and then he proceeds to say about fifteen different things. Different Christian traditions group them together differently.

But more importantly, Exodus 20:13 does not say ""thou shalt not kill."" Because it's not in English. It says thou shalt not ""retzach.""

What did ""retzach"" mean to Jewish tribesmen living in 950 BCE? It's not actually totally clear. It's used in a variety of ways throughout the Old Testament. And the meanings of words can change drastically within a single generation - I've seen it happen to quite a few words just within my own lifetime.

But there are Biblical scholars who think it's pretty clear that the closest possible translation to ""retzach"" is ""murder."" (Though there are some subtle differences. Like in English, a lion would not murder a deer. But apparently a lion can retzach a deer.)

Because even in the Torah itself, there are commands to kill people. Like Leviticus 20:1-2. ""The Lord said to Moses... any\[one\] in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him.""

So, are we to believe that God said to Moses: ""People must not kill each other. Also, people must kill anyone who makes a child sacrifice to Molek""?

Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

But in Leviticus 20, God doesn't use the word ""retzach."" He uses the word ""môt."" Which basically means ""to make dead.""

An AI might perhaps merge all 100 images together to form an image that barely looks like a tree. While if I ask a human to create me a tree, each humans tree will have different style, technique, pattern and stroke size. This emerged from conceptualization and was executed from a plan. Which led to creation. You can definitely program these parameters into an AI but they will always require a human touch. Art represents the monumental expression of creativity that stirs emotions.

iicuejx,PreacherJudge,"&gt; With AI art and AI scriptwriting like DALLE and AI dungeon, proof that AI can already construct art just as well, if not better than humans, there is no reason for a company to hire a worker over a machine.

This is obviously untrue.

What I think you mean to say here is that these tools suggest that at some point in the future, AI will be able to make art as well as humans do.  I'm concerned here, though, because it's very hard for non-experts to talk about hypothetical future technology that might not ever exist.

You are also ignoring that the fun of things like DALLE and AI dungeon is that they're in the uncanny valley, which is what makes them weird and funny.  They're close enough to what a human would make, but they're also extremely stupid and they swerve in unexpected ways.  VERY few people go to them for anything but amusement.

&gt; No one will go through the trouble of hiring a graphic designer or artist when AI can instantly generate pictures, concept art, game portraits or scripts for movies.

You're not appreciating the tradeoff of randomness and coherence.  To an AI, creativity is just randomness, and because of that, it's very hard to get them to be creative in a way that makes any sense.  Human curation helps some, but that brings in its own problems: the rules of creativity being *crowdsourced* will pretty much by definition keep creativity from being anything at all. 

And, as others have said: what'll all this be trained on?  If no humans are making art to be fed to the AI, then everything will just stagnate.",False
iicuw7y,teamfun411,"Many art jobs can’t be replaced by AI yet. Animation. 3D modeling. Rigging. Lighting. VFX animation.  Photography. Film editing. Storyboarding. 

I can see AI being used to replace illustration jobs for articles. But a lot of places that would do this are already going to just use stock photography. 

AI can do early concept art, but at a certain point concept art needs to be refined so that it can be actually built, and AI software can’t do any of those final steps. Maybe there will be fewer concept art jobs because this software makes it much faster to make concept art. But… a bulk of a production studio isn’t concept artists. 

House of Cards was not written by AI, it was written by people. But decisions early on in its process were made by AI, like choosing a star and choosing a director. This isn’t replacing artists, its making decisions that executives make. 

And a problem with AI writing so far is it doesn’t understand things like subtext, metaphor, or symbolism. I also think this stuff is bad at writing really long form stories that are coherent. At this time it can’t seem to do things like build complex characters, and then keep those characters consistent through a story, or give them arcs. It can’t really write jokes either, and it’s really far away from writing funny storylines.",False

We've created ways to accelerate design, music production, building and so on, but we'll keep creating and art will evolve and we'll find ways to create more art, different art even.

iicyiqt,budlejari,"&gt; Why then couldn’t we set aside some of our innovation brilliancy to shaving off those last few hours of everyday manual labour?

We have. The difference is that there is not enough *demand* for it in homes to drive the cost down and therefore make it affordable. The technology already exists in industry - clothing factories do already wash, iron, fold, and sort by machine but they do so because there is high demand and low variety. They exist in places like laundrettes for hospitals, where they get sheets, curtains, gowns etc, and similar items with little differences. The average home does what... 3-5 loads of washing a week of maybe 50-150 lbs of laundry over them all, spread over 7 days? A factory does *hundreds of tons* per day and each stage is done by a unique bot that is specialised to the task. 

In a home, that would be wasted. A machine that only sorted socks, for example, would get maybe 20 pairs a week? How is that economical to run? 

What you're asking for is a *general purpose robot* that automates multiple processes and that, my friend, is much much much more difficult. How hard should it scrub for linen? For lace? For sexy lingerie versus general purpose boxers? How should it handle folding bras versus crop tops of different weights? A coat? A sports kit? Each different iteration of a problem needs tailoring and a decision tree and different factors weighing in. It needs a multitude of skills and each one has to be better than a human to make it worth it to pay that kind of cost. It has to have fail safes and to know what to do in every situation that it might come across, such as ""I found a pen in this pocket. Do I put in the machine or not? What about a bobby pin? Rocks? Paper? Ink cartridges? A mobile phone? Coins? A live animal?"" 

That's the problem. We already have the technology that does this but a human is faster, cheaper, more accessible, and easier to store in the home than any robot you could create to handle all these problems.",False

Women can be aggressive and sexual harassers as well, but it is not a societal norm for them like it is for men. When people encourage men to be emotionally expressive, it means talking to their friends and close ones about how they feel, or going to therapy.

Also, you seem to be agreeing with me by stating ""a societal norm for them like it is for men,"" that it is ""particularly potent in men,"" or are you claiming that sexual drive/agression is reinforced in men as a social construct?

Finally, I considered the ""emotional expression"" movement to refer to all facets of life, whether within one's personal circle or in a public arena, specifically focusing on the apparent divide in how emotional expressions are perceived in a male and female.

iiewv7q,masterofyourhouse,"Yes, I am saying that the reason why sexual harassment and aggression are so much more prevalent in men is because our society enables and reinforces that kind of behaviour, and that it is not inherent in manhood as opposed to womanhood. 

Also, going back to healthy vs. unhealthy expression: in both cases you are expressing your emotions. It is just the way in which you do it that is important. It’s a very common idea in therapy that there is no such thing as a “bad” emotion. How you feel is just how you feel, and it’s how you respond to that that’s important. Either way, it’s important to acknowledge your emotions and give them space, and simply experience them, rather than bottling them up.",False
iiexfvh,ImpulsiveAbstraction,"What does ""simply experiencing aggression"" or ""simply experiencing sexual attraction"" look like?

iiez0j5,masterofyourhouse,"Aggression is a manifestation of emotion, not an emotion itself. The emotion may be anger, and instead of being aggressive, you could vent to someone about how angry you feel, punch a pillow, etc. And while sexual attraction isn’t an emotion, there are plenty of people on a daily basis who feel sexually attracted to people without harassing someone. You can just think “oh, they’re attractive”, and move on with your day. Because most people don’t pursue every sexually attractive person they meet. 

As for reinforcing behaviours, it’s all about what society deems permissible and impermissible. In terms of sexual harassment, rape culture is predominant, and creates an environment that is conducive to men harassing women, whereas women’s sexuality is repressed. And in terms of aggression, traditional masculinity is strongly associated with that. The whole concept of the “alpha male” is contingent on that kind of aggression.",False
iiethpp,I_am_the_night,"&gt;If a sexual and aggressive drive is more prevalent and potent in men, who have each in turn put themselves in iffy situations as I have, it seems to me to point to a call for restraint and, sometimes in my case, a fear of unleashing the beast. Either that or an understanding by both parties that restraint is an option that may be preferred.

And 

&gt;So I suppose my case is to be careful what you wish for and specify in what form it should be done, because from personal experience there are legitimate feelings in men that are best left unsaid.

I don't really understand how these describe a conflict.  Even if men are, on average, more sexually aggressive or have higher sex drives, this in no way conflicts with a movement encouraging men to be more emotionally expressive.  In fact, teaching men to express their sexuality and aggression in healthier and more respectful ways is exactly the kind of thing people are talking about when they say they want to teach men to be more expressive.

Not only do these issues not conflict at all, movements encouraging men to be more emotionally expressive and sensitive are actually a great way to address toxic sexual attitudes and unhealthy expressions of sexuality.",False
