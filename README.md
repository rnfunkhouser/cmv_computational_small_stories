This folder contains the data, code, results, and write-up for the project "Small Stories in Big Data" by Ryan Funkhouser. This project aims to test the influence of small stories on the outcomes of deliberations on r/ChangeMyView. To accomplish this, it will train a supervised machine learning text classification algorithm to identify which comments contain small stories and test the relationship between persuasive outcomes (receiving a 'delta' in the subreddit) and the presence or absence of small stories. It is currently (as of May 1st, 2024) a work in progress. 

In this repository, you will find the following:
  1) The 'data' folder which contains one month of data (July 2022) from the r/CMV subreddit. The project will eventually be executed on the entire corpus of data in the subreddit.
  2) The 'code' folder which contains a data processing file which is used to process the data and a classifier code document used to train the transformer model to detect small stories.
  3) The 'results' folder which is where the results from the code will be stored.
  4) The 'docs' folder which includes a text file with a link to the Overleaf LaTex file (currently in progress) for this project.
